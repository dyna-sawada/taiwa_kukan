Hello, everyone.Today's topic is using private homes as hotels for school trip should be [banned?]. We defined that using private homes as hotels on at least one night for school trips should be banned. We have two points. The first point is not professional. The second point is teachers cannot look after their children. 
I will explain the first point, not professional. We believe that private homes is very difficult to stay for students. Let's think about the situation that troubles happen between students and students. The owner of private homes want to response to the troubles like these students claim and [sorts?] the cause of the troubles. However, they are not professional to owned hotel and response to trouble too. They can't do anything in this situation. It is very dangerous for students too. Risk [inaudible] the trouble is danger of students' lives, like a big fire. How they can response to the problem? They have no way to solve these problems. It is very dangerous for the students, I think. So students have fun and safe school trips... therefore, using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned.
Yes [applause]. Okay. Hello, everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Let me rebut what the government team said. They said trouble can happen between students. Right? However, it is necessary for students to brave each other sometimes. So therefore, [ask?] yes.
Next, let me explain our point. We have two points. The first point is communicating with local people. The second point is low cost. I will explain the first point. In the school trip, students go to a traditional place such as Tōdai-ji, Kiyomizu-dera, Kinkaku-ji, and they stay near the place. Then, if they use private homes as hotels, they can learn the traditional things from the local people living there and can talk with them. They can also get a communication. Therefore, using private homes as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Thank you.
Hello.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Let me rebut the opposition's first point. They said that in school trip, it is good for students to communicate with local people, and using private homes enables them to do that. However, well, maybe, I think schools can provide students with the opportunity to communicate with local people in other forms, not the home of-- not the form of using private homes because, as our first speaker said, using private homes makes students more likely to make troubles. So we should not use-- we should not provide students the opportunity to communicate with local people as a form of using private homes. Maybe we can make a time to talk with local people. Therefore, their point doesn't stand. 
Next, let me [recontract?] government's first point. They said student's sometimes not make trouble-- sometimes make trouble. However, in other words, students sometimes make trouble. And we should think about this time. So students sometimes make trouble. So we should keep them from making trouble. We should make them less likely to make trouble each other. Therefore, our point stands. 
Now, let me explain our second point. Teachers can not look after children. We believe that using private homes make it impossible for the teachers to look after students. If we use hotels, teachers can stay at the same place with students. So they can patrol around the hotel and stop students from making trouble, such as making loud noise at midnight, or something like that. So in hotel, troubles are far less likely to happen. And in hotel, even if children make some trouble, teachers can deal with it immediately. But what if we allowed them to use private homes as hotels? As I said before, problems are more likely to happen than using hotel, but teachers can not deal with problem immediately, which means troubles are likely to getting worse and worse by the time the teachers come to the house. If our students brought something into private homes and hotel, maybe hotel manager and teacher will be a good help and solve the trouble immediately. But if we use private homes, maybe the owner of the private home is getting angry and angry at the students by the time teacher comes to the private home. And sometimes it can be a trouble between students and the owner of the private home. Therefore, using private homes [applause] as a hotel should be banned. Thank you for listening.
Hello.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. I will explain about the second point, a low cost. I think that good hotels are expensive and private homes as hotels [inaudible]. Why? Because they don't have to pay salary for workers. And private homes as hotels is as good as hotels because they have strict standards for [country?]. They have to meet strict standards. And private homes as hotels are homes, so students do many things freely. 
Let me rebut for the first point of the opposition. Their first point is they are not professional. Trouble can happen, big fire, crime; they can't do anything. But we think that private homes as hotels have to meet strict standards so they can do everything as a hotel. So it is expensive. We think we should stay at a low-cost hotel as a private homes are hotels. 
Their second point, teacher can't look after children, impossible. But we think that private homes as hotels have to meet strict and-- so private homes as hotels are very safety. So teachers don't have to spend many times for students. And private homes as hotels are homes, so students do many things freely. 
And we think that-- we believe that most important things for school trip is what they can learn. So communicating with local people. So they can learn traditional things with the local people. So--POI.Sorry. So they can learn about local things with them [applause]. Thank you [applause].
Yes. Hi, everyone.Let me rebut government's first point. They said it can happen to students, trouble. But there are others at the private homes, so they can stop the trouble. If the [others?] can't stop the troubles, teachers can't stop too. What's the difference between teachers and others? And they said if a fire breaks out at the private home, it is dangerous. But think about this, if the hotels-- many students at the [inaudible] hotels and a fire breaks out at the [inaudible] hotels-- fire breaks out at the private homes, few students stay at the [inaudible] homes, so students can escape more easily than staying at the--POI.Sorry. So it is safety to stay at the private homes. And students can learn from locals people talking. So communicate with local people, it's important. And if we can stay low-cost, we can pay other things. So I believe that-- so I believe using private hotels as hotels is good for school trips shouldn't be banned. Thank you.
Hello, everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. First, let me rebut opposition's second point. They said we can stay at private homes at lower cost than staying at hotels. However, lowering cost is for schools. Schools should provide fun school trips to children. If we will rethink about what is good for children, we should make children more safety. Therefore, using private homes as hotels for--POI.--sorry --school trips should be banned. 
Then I will summarize today's debate. The most important point is if children can be fun and safety during school trips. On this point, their idea is that we can stay at private homes at lower cost than staying at hotels, and children can communicate with local people. And that this may be fun for children. However, our argument is superior because staying at private homes are likely to make more trouble because, first, private homes are [and?] by local people so that means they are not professional. So they maybe can't deal with the troubles caused by children properly. And second, we have to protect children from the risk of troubles. If they--POI.Sorry. If they stay at the hotel, teachers can't look after them because they are in different places. That means children's safety is threatened. So I think staying at private homes is more likely to cause troubles than staying at hotels. They said they can learn many things-- that children can learn many things about the local people, but I think we can make space [inaudible] time for that. And so the most important thing is if children can be fun and safety during school trips. Please think about what we said here for children's--POI--safety. Sorry. Therefore, using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Thank you.Okay. Thank you [applause].
I framed our [inaudible]. [inaudible]. Our first point is risk for students, risk for students. And our second point is burden of family. 
I will explain our first point. Our first point is risk for students. I'll focus on hotel first. Hotel is a place for-- sorry, sorry. So first, I will define [inaudible]. We'll define the school trip is for high school students, junior high school students, and their elementary school students, and teachers. At least one teacher monitor each house.Sorry. I'll explain our first point. First, hotel is place for staying. And we can stay at the same place and facility is [inaudible] is limited to the things for staying. However, a private home, we can stay at the same place because house has the limited space, and if there is many students, we have to stay at different houses. So the teacher, who can monitor the students, is limited and the monitoring has the limit. So the problem is monitor is difficult. And in house, there is many dangerous things. For example, knife, or--[inaudible].Sorry. We can go easy, easy, and teacher can't monitor.[inaudible].Yes.So you said if students are stay at private home, teacher cannot monitor the student all the time. However, if students stay at hotel, also teacher cannot monitor all the time. So why can you say such things? Please explain [the reasoning?].Yes. I'm sure, yeah, we can't monitor all of the students in hotel, too. However, hotel has limited facilities so the-- so sorry. It's safer than house, private house. So I will continue in my speech. As I said, private home has many dangerous things, and students can easily go outside and there is many dangerous things. So what is important things, is monitoring is limited and house is a private space, so there is many dangerous things, so it will be a risk. It is a risk for students. So we strongly believe that we should have this ban. Do you have any points? Thank you.
Hello everyone. Thank you, chairperson. We strongly believe that using private home as hotels for school trips should not be banned. In this case, [inaudible] point. First, [inaudible]. They say that if [inaudible] students by teachers. However, why do student needs teacher's monitoring? Student have to behave self control, so we believe, so their argument is weak.Point.No thank you. Let's move on to our point-- sorry, before our points, I will explain our team line?]. Our [team line?] is today we focus on school trips, so it's completely different from usual trips. So a trip is a kind of study, we believe, so please keep in your mind. 
Next, let's move on to our points. Today we have two points. The first point is private lodgings will become good experience. It is good experience. And second point is, private home brings two advantage. Private homes bring two advantage.I will bring our first point is good experience. [inaudible] many school use this system, that's because by staying at home of local people, student can understand the life of the place deeply. For example, they have many opportunities that student can listen about the place from host family. In my case, this December I went to Okinawa and I stayed at a private home. And my host mother told us about war of Okinawa. And [inaudible] the habit in the [parks?] in the place. So I could understand deeply about it, and also I could find many new things through private [inaudible]. So--Point of information?No thank you. So that's why, anyway it becomes good experience for teacher by staying the private homes. And also, host family will take us to many places. It mean we [shall?] see the latest region, or the place, and experience many things, like eating local food, and so one. That's why there is very good point of private homes, staying private home. And in other case, if student go overseas, [inaudible] students use other [inaudible] were in groups [inaudible]. In addition, if we stay private home, we can know their information. So even after we go back home, we can contact with them for a long time, so here is also good experience. However, I'm [inaudible] student cannot experience such things. However, our [team line?] learning about the local place is meaning of school trips, right? So taking this motion it's bad effects for students, that's why we do not [inaudible] this motion and therefore we strongly oppose this motion. Thank you.
Here, here. [applause]. Okay. I'll start my speech. My name is [Kidarari?]. First, I will reconstruct our first point. They said that teacher's monitoring is required because students have a kind of a manner, but even if the school trip is a studying, students are getting so excited in their school trips because they will go to be another places. So the teacher monitoring should be required because--[inaudible].Sorry. Students can get so excited. 
And also I will explain our second point. Our second point is burden on family, burden on family. Students will stay at private homes, and then especially elementary school students will be noisy. And also junior high and high school students will also are excited to school trips. So they lack their manner and behavior or such things at the private homes. It is a high possibility. And so residents in that home get stressed or burdened. For example, late at night, students will surely talk with each other about their school trips, and then they will forget about private homes' residents.[inaudible].Sorry. So they will speak very loudly. They will speak very loudly. And also I haven't experienced such things. So residents can't sleep well at night, and residents get stressed, or a nuisance about them. So the importance is the family's burden or stress will increase by introducing the using private homes as hotels. So it means it is not good things.I'll repeat our second point. Second point is burden of family. Students will get excited by going to school trip, especially elementary school students have a little experience of their life. So it means they didn't learn manner or behavior completely, so it means students-- it's a high possibility that students will lack behavior or manner at private homes. And then the residents will get stressed by that. So we strongly believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Thank you.
I will rebut to their first point. They said students can get good experience by using private homes, but in the school trips, and also they talked about the Okinawa experience, and host mother told me about the [inaudible]. But in the school trips, school surely conducts the plan that students can study about their places. So without hosts family, students can learn their place's features, or something like that. So it means we don't need the host family-- host family should not tell them about the features of their places, or something like that. So it means their first point doesn't stand.
Hi, everyone. [inaudible] for this motion [inaudible] to cover [inaudible] point [inaudible] of visit. The first speaker said [inaudible] this program for the students. However, they didn't mention how long they stay. So if students go to school trip [inaudible]. [inaudible] there on the [inaudible] situation, so it's not program. 
And next their second speaker said students in elementary or junior high school students are noisy. However, school usually prepares [inaudible] manner in private homes.[inaudible]No thank you. So it's school's responsibility so we don't have to worry about that. So [inaudible]. This is not staying private homes students can experience. However, we believe it's important to talk with people who live in local [inaudible] so it's not enough in stay a hotel. 
So [inaudible]. [inaudible] our some point, we believe private [inaudible] experience to advantage for us. First is we can reduce costs. We can reduce costs. Second inaudible] and [inaudible] one by one. Plus, as we know, using private [residence?] is cheaper than a hotel. So we can [inaudible] reduce costs, so we can [inaudible] their money. Another thing, for example, [experience?] program for students. That's why students can get more experience, or think [inaudible] before to use hotels. And in the other hand, parents [inaudible] also become cheaper. So as for reducing costs, not only students, but also their parents gets advantage, so it's very big benefit for us.
And then we move our next point. [inaudible] and [inaudible] experience [inaudible] type of such people experience of a type of accept people, they try to guide their uniqueness [inaudible] and [inaudible]. So that's why private [inaudible] leads to [inaudible] because they [inaudible] where they bring their--Point of information.No thank you. So in my case, I have experience [three times?] private [lodging?] in [Austria?], [inaudible], and Okinawa. And all of them guide me a lot of original place within a place. So in that time, I communicate with them and this is also advantage [inaudible]. So that's why therefore we [inaudible] this motion. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. [inaudible]. Well, [let me summarize?] [inaudible]. The most important point is what is the purpose of school trip? What is the purpose of school trips? Then our point about we'll explain it are two advantage. Our [team line?] school trips is not just trip. It has big purpose to study. In fact, many school visits to Okinawa, or Hiroshima, [inaudible] is worth studying. So when the students [inaudible] and [inaudible] history. [inaudible] purpose to study. And now we can stay hotel anywhere and whenever because there are many hotel in Japan, or [around the world?]. And so school trip is very good [inaudible] to stay local homes. And in this you'll find a good home because if we try to find a local home, it's difficult. But if we don't take this motion, it becomes easy because school can't [inaudible] students as a school study. And today I have big flash point. Whether it's private people using private home, or hotel. [inaudible] knows that students will be nosy, its mean there is the [inaudible] for such things. However, at a hotel there are many ordinary guests, so staying in hotel would lessen it's burdens, lessen it's burdens. And our [inaudible] even if students are excited, they have manner, and they told about this behavior before school trip by teachers. So we didn't have to worry about this. And so we are sure using private homes we believe [inaudible] students and also the parents because of cost and relationship with local people. So therefore, we should not take this motion. That's all, thank you.
Thank you. [inaudible] revoke their second point. They said they can reduce the costs, but they didn't explain how possible because--[inaudible].So you said that we didn't mention the but detailed costs, but usually the private home is [inaudible] so usually the costs of a hotel is more higher than private school. So how much do you think about explain it?Yeah. Generally speaking, the costs of the private home-- they didn't explain the second point as [inaudible]. The private home is not the it is-- sorry. 
I will explain the most important point. Our most important point is happy school trip for students, happy school trip for students. So let me ask you a question, whether students will spend happy school trips after introducing this motion. From this point, I would like to compare their first point argument and our first argument. They say the students can experience a lot of things in private home. However,we insisted that there is high possibility to experience to be dangered, because teachers cannot monitor--[inaudible].Sorry. And their first argument it is possible to [learn such?] [inaudible] experience in the internet, or to be the [inaudible] in this place. They didn't explain the uniqueness. Even if-- and about their second point--[inaudible].Sorry. Even if their [inaudible] to be behaving in good manner, necessary elementary schools cannot behave in such ways. Because they are so excited, as our second speaker said. So they're [inaudible]. And their first question, they questioned the cost is the private hotel is volunteer, but they're not volunteer--[inaudible].Sorry. Volunteer facility and they didn't explain the [inaudible] costs and we didn't understand how the costs will be count. So, okay. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. Today's topic is using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. We find that there are no [inaudible]. There are enough rooms for staying in the building. We have two points. The first point is trouble with [inaudible]. The second point is lack of safety. Our second point will be explained by second speaker.Point.Sorry, no thanks.
Now I will explain the first point. The first point, trouble with [neighboring living?]. We believe that [inaudible] there are [inaudible] in Japan. If another [inaudible] school students use these private homes it will trouble with [inaudible] residents. For example, some using private homes have only one [inaudible], so there will be so conditions that are not that other neighboring residents can use it. So this will be so noisy that neighboring visitors can be [inaudible]. We can see some students on school trips are so noisy on their trips. In relationship of students and the neighboring residents and there will be [wars?]. And their school can't use these [inaudible] private homes this year. It's not benefit for each other. So we have to ban using them for school trips. [inaudible]. Using private homes as [inaudible] school trips. Therefore, we believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned.
Hello, everyone? My name is [inaudible]. First let me [inaudible] first point [inaudible] that if it's a local [inaudible] it connects to other [inaudible]. However, it's not always true. Because now in Japan have a law of using private homes as, a hotel, so we have the way to improve this situation and also using-- sorry, using private homes as hotels means that okay, okay to neighbor people can-- neighbor people allowed to [inaudible] using private homes as hotels, so it is not always true. 
Secondly, let me explain our point. We have two point. Our first point is losing of choice, losing of choice. And second point is losing opportunity of [inaudible] private homes, losing opportunity of [inaudible] using private homes.Firstly, let me explain our first point. Firstly, what's the proper [inaudible]? For example, living alone, or making good memories and students enjoy the school trips. Also, using private homes as hotels is [inaudible]-- sorry, has [inaudible]. For example, there are very few [inaudible] for parents because of using private homes as hotels is cheaper than using hotels. It means that students who ask people [inaudible] can join the [inaudible] more esaily. [inaudible] can living alone or making the memories. As I said, it is [proper?] for the schools-- sorry. Also [inaudible] experience many things. Students can experience many things because of living private homes as hotel is very experience so a lot of life under-- we can learn that life to-- we can learn to like their people, so their people's life, so it is-- and also we should not [losing?] this good affect on those-- we should not losing this choice. Therefore, we should not using-- we using private homes as hotels for school [inaudible] should not be banned. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. Let me a little bit [inaudible] points. They said it is important for cheaper for burden for family. But it is not-- it doesn't good. Because we have to think of as cheaper than safety of students. So [inaudible] of this, it has no meaning for school [choice?]. So next is our definition. Our definition is there are no [inaudible] and they are enough-- as enough of [inaudible] for staying in the buildings. 
And next [inaudible] government's first point. They said about using private homes [inaudible] but what's the process of laws they didn't say. So [it's a mistake?]. 
So let me explain our second point.Our second point is lack of safety. [inaudible] have some stuffs, but using private homes didn't help them. It's hard to say safety because it doesn't have [inaudible] like being [lacking?] [inaudible] [attendants?]. [inaudible] cause many burdens. For example, [inaudible] person in-- sorry. Enter in the building and [learn?] which student are staying have problem. No one's against about it who can use it. Who can [fix?] our service. And so didn't have to [inaudible] staying teacher, or [inaudible] because we defined this. And teacher have to move for taking care of students, but it is clearly impossible because teacher will [inaudible] for student's safety. But student won't [inaudible] with friends, or moving [freely?]. It means teachers can check students' safety [inaudible] for students [inaudible] teachers have to take safety for their [inaudible] safety and lives and. So teachers' burden is so heavy. Therefore, we move that we shouldn't think that [inaudible]. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. My name is [Thrita?]. We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. I [inaudible] first and second point. Our second point and their second point is comfort. Our first point-- our second point are their [inaudible]. I will [inaudible] the first point with our experience. Second point. I will [inaudible] their second-- first and second points are [inaudible] are decreasing a choice of [inaudible]. And their second speaker said that so that [inaudible] because if they don't have to taking chair, or students but in the process of [inaudible] for using private homes-- there is so. They know about it, why it is problem. They know about it and there is many object of school [choice?], so we think they are taking this [inaudible] to [inaudible] choice, it is very [inaudible]. In school there are many people who don't have the mother and the father and [inaudible]. And there are many people and [inaudible] and it's very [inaudible] because our first speaker say that after taking [inaudible] freedom is but and choice. But [inaudible] choice and [inaudible].And their first and second point is not the reason we [inaudible] and to [inaudible]. To avoid [inaudible]. So their first and second point does not stand. 
I will explain our second point. Our second point is losing opportunity of-- [inaudible] using private homes. Losing opportunity of [inaudible] using private homes. Our first point is to-- our second point is conflict with their [inaudible]. Their first point [inaudible] not school trips. The choice of not choice, are not students will not use it. And they will not choose private homes. But it is not happen. [inaudible] explain is more make [inaudible] situation because there-- there are many process of [stipulation?] of using private homes. For example, [inaudible] and any [inaudible] but because there are many rule of using private homes and the people who make the using private homes, using private homes have to [inaudible] anything. And we think this ban to-- we tkae this [inaudible] to using private homes will be opportunity will deflated and problem for them because of the any-- we have to-- there are many costs for them to [inaudible] using private homes, making private homes, that [inaudible] which they cannot get any benefit of private home. Making private homes-- it is very much problem. It make losing opportunity-- it mean [inaudible] of using private homes. Therefore we should not take this ban. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. My name's [Samantha?]. Using private home as hotels for school trips should not be banned. First, I will summarize [inaudible]. In this case, using private homes is [inaudible] many problems. However, it is not true [inaudible] government make [inaudible] of private homes. Problem happen from [inaudible]. So [inaudible]. And the second point is what [inaudible] it is not true, and [inaudible]. [inaudible] and our first argument is [inaudible] students are now-- there are students who cannot join [inaudible] for money. They cannot [reverse?] this point. And in this case, [inaudible] so with that private homes, they cannot [inaudible]. It is very something. And also, in the first place, [inaudible]. Learning so private home is [inaudible] way to in order to [inaudible] proper because if we use private homes we can learn the other [inaudible]. So we can learn the other [inaudible]. [inaudible] for students to promote their study. So our argument is [inaudible] response. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. I will explain the first point, trouble with neighbors. Students are looking forward to their trip, so they will be noisy. However, in private lodging, they have many neighbors among them. And to make noisy [inaudible] neighbors. For example, at present situation many noisy-- making noisy by students pose many problems. First example, public transportation shows that. Often elementary school and junior high school and high school students make noisy in the train. And others make trouble to other passengers. And the second example is that kindergarten is often noisy. So that the neighbors pose the trouble and. So it is not beneficial for neighbors. What is more, is that-- sorry. So it is not benefit for neighbors.And I will explain the second point. The second point is lack of safety. Present situation, most schools they [inaudible] hotels enough. However, private lodging there are no safety than hotels because hotels have lots accommodations [inaudible]. However, lodging house cannot have safety so many.POI.No. And school teachers have to protect school safety. However, they cannot and to through. And now safety. They said that the school can [inaudible] cheaply, but safety should be [inaudible] in cost because private lodgings, there are no [inaudible] intendents, and there are not enough [inaudible] for staying in that building. And so it's not [inaudible]. And that first point is--Point.No thank you. So we believe that using private homes for school trips should be banned.



Hello, everyone. It is quite [inaudible] teachers to supervise all the students and in case they stay in alternate families. So we can never achieve the goal of the-- we can never achieve the goal of this [inaudible] in this case. That's why we are [inaudible] propose this motion today. So I will show a definition. So a student still will stay in other family [inaudible]. So this will include a school trip of elementary school, and junior high school, and high school. So today, we have two arguments, and first is about the safety on the-- this will invade the safety of this possibility of this school trip. And second is about there will be a gap between the students by staying the alternate families. Yes, please.Could you explain the second point?Okay. Second point is that they will be gap between the students by staying in the alternate families. 
So our first one is that. And there will be invasion of the safety in this possibility in case of this motion. So let me give it to you [inaudible]. First is about staying in hotel. So in the hotel, all student will get in one place and all student will stay in one place and stay in one hotel. So if there are some trouble, that professional crew can deal with the troubles. So I know so the schools and teachers can supervise all the student in that case. And also, they can make limitation of the students' behavior. For example, the teachers can ban to go out after 11:00 PM like this. So in case of a hotel, it is quite easy for the teachers to limit the student behavior and they supervise all the students. However, in case of other families, the small group of student will scatter around alternate families. So it is quite difficult for teachers to look out all the students, so they will stay in different place. So it's quite difficult-- it is quite difficult for the teachers to supervise all the students. As a result, they cannot limit the student behavior, and also, other family will-- so it is still other family who will deal with the students. So they can never deal with dangerous cases.For example, if the student cause some illness their other family, their other family, they do not have any special [inaudible], so they cannot know how to do that. How do you deal with that situation? So they will be panic, and whatever. There will be same problem-- there was some trouble between the students and alternate families. For example, I [inaudible] student [inaudible] really bad. They will be [inaudible] and they will be some fight between student and family and [inaudible]. And in the worst case, because the other families place is quite hidden place, so there will be some kidnap case in [inaudible] high school student will kidnapped in case if they ban [inaudible] and stayed in the private families. So like this, there are so many trouble between the students and other families because it is a very hidden place in case of private family, and the teacher is difficult to supervise all the student, and it's good to look after all the student in this case. So this is huge list of making trouble. And sometimes, they will commit a crime, so that's why we are propose this motion. Thank you.
[inaudible] not be banned. [inaudible] government said. [inaudible] students. It is [inaudible].How do I [inaudible]? We believe that using private home or hotels for school trips should not be banned. [inaudible] what the government team said. All they said that for the teacher to supervise all the students is very difficult in the case that using private homes, but I think it is not true. [inaudible] people can contact to the teachers by using phones and--Information. However, in the case of using regular homes, they have to use a lot of homes, like [inaudible] homes.Yes, yes.But if it's hotel with only one hotels, we think it's much more easier.Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Although, I think it is easy, but I want to say that by using private homes, both of the students-- both of the cases, we can deal with-- teachers can deal with the problems. 
Next, let me explain our points. We have two points. The first point is that we can see the traditions there. The second point is that it is to benefit for the community. So I will explain the first point. We can see the traditions. We believe that if the students use private homes as hotels for school trips, they can communicate with [inaudible] people very closely. For example, they can [inaudible] special foods and participate in [inaudible] and incorporate with the work. [inaudible] work, for example--Information.--[crosstalk]. By doing it, students can see traditions there. And by understanding this, these traditional cultures, they come to be able to accept various types of cultures. And it is so beneficial for students, I think, because the world is becoming [universal?]. So by understanding that other types of the cultures--Information. We understand that you can have experience, but there's big difference [inaudible] by housing. Some houses can good experience. Some houses can be no experience [inaudible]. What do you think about this point?Yes, yes, yes. Although it is true, but if we stay in the hotels, all of the students cannot experience the [inaudible] traditional. But by participate in the [inaudible] hotels, some of the students can experience the [inaudible] traditional. So it is small experience staying in the hotels. Therefore, we strongly believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. Thank you.
We believe that it's the school's responsibility to guarantee safety and experience of students during school trips. However, by sending students to private homes, it's impossible for teachers to supervise each student, so we cannot guarantee this. So first, let me refute their first argument. In their first argument, they explained that students will be able to experience some tradition by staying at private homes. However, this is not-- first, we have two points for this. First, it's not unique, because we don't have to actually stay in the private home in order to experience tradition. For example, we went to a school trip in Okinawa last week, and we were able to spend a day with a taxi driver. And the taxi driver is a person from Okinawa, so the taxi driver told us a lot about tradition of Okinawa. So we believe that it's not unique. And second point is that not all students can experience the tradition by staying in a private home, and we will explain this in our second argument, that there's this huge gap between students of the experience that they could-- of their experiences. 
So let me go onto our second argument. In our second argument, we'll explain mainly two points. First, what kind of problems are there? And secondly, why is this so serious? About the first point, most students will be able to have a fun experience with families. However, we believe that there's some houses that do not provide the best experience for students. For example, there is families who do not do anything for students. For example, there is families that just have students stay at their home and the family doesn't take the student to anywhere, so the student cannot do any experience.And moreover, there's actual cases where the family just had the students stay at their home and they don't even let them use the air conditioner, for example. And this is very serious because some families are very nice to their students, but other families are very cruel, and they don't have any-- they don't do anything for students. So secondly, why is this so important and why is this so serious? Well, we believe that each family of those students, the student pay a lot of money for the school trip, and the student has only a few times during their lives. So school trips are very important for the students. So first reason, we believe that the school must guarantee the experience that the student has because the family pays a lot of money and it's a very precious experience. And however, by having the students stay at private homes, it means that some students will have a good experience, but some students may not have a good experience, so we cannot guarantee that everyone will have the same level of experience, so we believe it's a really important problem. 
So finally, let me reconstruct our first argument. See, our first argument, they explain that the local people can contact teachers, and this will guarantee the safety. However, for two points, we believe that this isn't actually practical. First, families have the incentive to harm students like we explained in our first argument. These families, will they contact the teachers? Probably not. And secondly, we believe that it is the teachers' responsibility, not the families' responsibility, to protect students. So we believe that the teachers must be able to directly protect the students. So for these reasons, we are proud to propose [inaudible]. Thank you.

 [inaudible] will not be banned.We believe that--[crosstalk].--to using private homes as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Let me rebuttal the government's first point. They said there is a problem to the safety. You said to the staying in the hotel is too easy. It's easy to limit the school students. However, to stay in one place, it may prevent a [inaudible] for the other guests. So it is not-- so it is bad thing to-- yeah.More information? How does it radiate to the teachers' supervision?Sorry. Okay. [inaudible]. Okay. Okay. 
Next, let me rebuttal the government's second point. You said there is a gap between the staying of family. However, why students go to the-- why students go school trip? The answer is the teacher wants students to know that [the reason?] traditional [inaudible]. Okay.But in some houses, they can learn a lot of things, but in some houses, they cannot anything, although, they are putting a lot of money. Don't you think it's a problem for students.Yeah. Yeah. It is true, but to stay in hotel-- to stay in hotel, everyone can't get the traditional things. Yeah. Yeah.We believe that during the day, for example, we could learn a lot of tradition from taxi drivers or bus guides. We believe that these are [enough?].But it is limited time to stay private hotel. They always can get the enrichment. 
Okay. Then, let me explain our second point. Our second point is it is to benefit for region. So the region can take the cost of staying. So to take the cost of staying for the region, the more and the more the region can be reached. So the people who live in the region can take out large amount of welfare. So--More information.Sorry. So therefore, using private homes as hotels for student trips shouldn't be banned. It is our opinion. Thank you.
[inaudible]. Okay. So hello, everyone. We believe that using private home for school trips shouldn't be banned. So the point that you have, there's lots of safety in this kind of gap. Yeah. So I'd like to make a rebuttal. But my first point, the lack of safety is not true, because private homes are required some safety or responsibility to save students. It is [inaudible]. Yes, please.Is it the teachers' responsible-- we believe that it's the teachers' responsibility [inaudible].Oh, yes, yes. I know. I know. I know. Yeah. Teachers. Right. But people managing the health can do the [inaudible]. Why? Teachers should do that. The second point, you say there's kind of a gap. Yeah. I know the point, but it's not related to this motion. Because let's say that we should ban. Why do we have to ban this point? Your point is better. Yes, please.Will you explain that other purpose of school trip, all students must have a equal experience because there's a lot of money.No, no. [inaudible].That's why we should ban this point, we feel.No, no, no. Yeah. Okay. So in that point, schools should look for the private house previously in order to have students get good experience. That's behavior so that students are guaranteed to get-- good point. Okay? Back to some other points. But first, you can't see the tradition there, because staying here, we can't experience food, play music, and we can be aware of that. They may feel to preserve that. And, okay. Again, we can't-- no. The point is that we can vitalize their community, because using the private home, make demands. Demand makes much better profit. The community can get benefit there so that they can do that.Can you explain [inaudible]. [inaudible].[inaudible].[inaudible].[inaudible].
A quick clarification to the [inaudible] second argument. They have said by letting people stay in the public homes, maybe the local community benefit our money. However, we do not think they need [inaudible] them. Because first, even if students stay in hotels, students' hotel [inaudible] a lot of money or even community. A lot of [inaudible] to our money. So we do not think [inaudible] point to this motion. Moreover, what we should [inaudible] motion about the problem with students and teachers and what the problem of matter of community should come [inaudible] of the points. So we think it's not so important issue in this motion, so we should [inaudible] all these points. So first, as a government reply, I'd like to ask you two questions. First one is, whether just staying in public home has a good effect to students' experience of the purpose of school trip. And the second point that the school responsibility, whether staying in public homes should be justified or not. About the first point. The [inaudible] have said that by staying in public homes, they be able to have a lot of experience, so it's good. However, we have explained that. And in some houses, they can have good experience, but in some houses, they can do nothing. They just get homes without any air conditioners, and it would be very difficult for teachers to control this point. So at the purpose of school trip, all students are paying a lot of money and it's a very precious experience, so we think all the students have a equal very precious experience. However, once we introduce this kind of [inaudible] staying in public homes, some people can have good experience, but some people just stay there, although, they pay a lot of money. So we think it's really unfair and unresponsible of the school, so we should stop this and all students should stay in hotel. And even if they stay in hotel, they have a lot of other solution to have a good experience. It's more equal and fair of the student experience.
Next one is about school responsibility. So school trip is a school event, so teacher have a responsibility to protect each student, and they have to supervise the students. However, once students split into a lot of houses, a lot of public houses, school cannot supervise those houses because there are too many houses. And the people in their public houses are not specialized to the bad situations. Moreover, we have [inaudible] in some cases, they cannot get any experience, so they have some troubles against public people. Although, sometimes there are bad people who try to kidnap students, and they can never deny this point. Actually, these cases have already. However, once we stay in hotel, teacher can supervise everything and everyone in the hotel as a professional to protect all the people. We think it's much more safer and the responsibility of school. [inaudible] phone call, but I think there are too many houses, so it's really difficult phone call with houses. So in order for school to protect all students in one place, we think that we should protect them in one hotel rather than in public houses. Thank you very much.

Hello everyone.Today's topic is using private homes [inaudible] for school trips should be banned. First of all, let me define the motion as follows: first, private homes is a completely out of control of teachers because other people-- the students go to each families and stay there. And for a school trip is a one of the major studies like history or culture and it is a teacher's job to take care of the precious child from the parents and they have responsibility to protect them. And the private-- staying private home is from home staying because private is home is nobody take after the precious students so it is completely different. And next let me explain our points. We have two points. First is teachers have to take responsibility to protect students. And second is children will be in danger. 
Let me explain the first point. Teachers have the responsibility to protect students. Teacher has responsibility to take care of the precious child from the parents. It is-- a school trip is completely different from the private trips. So it is just studying so the teacher's duty is to provide safety environment for the student. And school trips should be conducted in safe environment and teachers should pay attention to all students because even in the hotel--[foreign]Yes please.The owner of the home can take care of the student.We can't say that all family can provide safe environment because this is all completely up to the families. And if we use the private hotels we have to do everything by themselves. For example not all families provide even food. They might be say that you should go to the other place to food-- to place to eating because we don't take care about you because it's not your home. Like this. And it will be in danger--[foreign]No thank you-- go to the-- go out in the night. So it is bad for the children. And also it is completely against-- no thank you. No thank you. It is against-- the school trip, it is meaningless because even-- to provide better education is a school trip but it is against the duties. So we back to propose this motion. Thank you. [applause]
Hello everyone.We believe that using private homes as a hotel or school trip should not be banned. Let me refer to what government team said is that the teacher have to take care of the students but it is a natural job of protecting our students. It is a natural job of teacher so it is not smart of mention about only about this activity and therefore your argument is not--[foreign]No thank you. 
Let me explain our point. We have two points. The first point is we can feel real culture and the second point is banning private homes as hotels for school trips will be lack of times to broaden one's student relationships. I'll explain the first point. We believe-- now let's think about the differences using private homes and other like hotel or inn. So of the first the direction of school trip is learn the sport. And moreover, using private homes will be-- means student work together with a local family-- local people's family. So it is chance to learn local languages, local lifestyles, local food and a [inaudible] way is living with local people--[foreign]No thank you-- student should be-- develop students in new world and having left devices to their self will be chance to independently so make one's breakfast or prepare a place to sleep, it is chance for students to independently but using hotel or inn is less than-- student served everything like food or sleep or bath so it is less than students-- growing student automaticity. So therefore using private homes a hotel for school trips will be-- make students [inaudible] independently and broaden view. So we believe using-- we should-- students using private homes as a hotel for school trips should not be banned. Thank you.
Hello everyone.Today we will [inaudible] using private homes as hotel for school trip should be banned. Firstly let me rebuff their cross point. On their cross point they said that students will be able to be in real culture by staying at home-- staying at local homes but-- and also they say that they can relate with local people. But firstly they misunderstand what staying in private home is. This is called [inaudible] and this is completely different from home staying or something like that because we are not sure if the family will provide food to them and we are not sure if local people will actively interact with students. So for example if a student didn't get food they have to go out to eat food. Then they cannot related with local people and they are [inaudible] happened. Also they say that the student will be independent but there are other ways to be independent from their parent. For example they just have to try to be independent at home. Staying at private home is very dangerous. So this is not proper--[foreign]No thank you-- this is not the proper way to be independent from their parent. 
So now let me reconstruct our first point. On our first point we say that teacher have to take care of the student because parents leave their precious children to the teacher and this is teacher's fundamental responsibility to take care of the student. On this point they say that of course protecting children is of course teacher's job. But they didn't attack our core point. Our core point is that after introducing-- after banning using private home as hotel for school trip teachers cannot take care of the student properly because--[foreign]No thank you. And they didn't attack our core point so our first point clearly stands. 
Now let me explain our second point. Our second point that student will be in danger. So normally when they go to school trip they stay in hotel with their teacher and the teacher say don't go out at night because it's dangerous. And this is-- going out at night is very dangerous because there's possibility of kidnapping and something like that. And--[foreign]Okay.The community [inaudible] has their responsibility. So they can control that time.But this school trip and the teacher have to be responsible for their children because the parents leave their children to the teacher. And this is teacher's responsibility to take care of the children. So and if they stay in private home the teacher cannot look at student and student can, "Oh we can do anything," and they just go out and have fun at night. And this is very dangerous and a disadvantage and using private home as hotel should be banned. Thank you.
Hello everyone.We believe that using private home as hotel for school trips should not be banned. Here let me reconstruct our first point. They can see real culture. They say that-- their [inaudible] the private homes-- in private homes there are no owner or family, right? [inaudible] definition. So it's nasty. Nasty definition. And not only definition-- we cannot do debate on such narrow definition so let me ignore such narrow definition. They say that--[foreign]No thank you. Sorry. We can enjoy being at the home with their friends so we cannot feel their culture but by staying at home we can say that we surely can see the real culture. So their argument is not true. 
And let me reconstruct our first point. Let me [inaudible] their first point. Teacher have to protect their children, the students. But the host family can protect students as well and the number of the guardians--[inaudible]Sorry. The number of the guardians will be increased by using private homes so--[foreign][foreign]Sorry. Sorry. 
So [inaudible] and as for their second point, they say that students can be in danger. This to be in danger. But as I mentioned the host family can also protect [inaudible]. So their argument is not true.[inaudible]
Sorry. That [inaudible] our second point.[foreign]Sorry. Human relationships, okay? Possible. Let me remember the meaning of that school trip. This school trip we have to study more. We have to see a lot of culture or we have broaden our way of thinking more. This is what school trip is. You might spend yours-- actually I have experienced staying at private homes when I was a junior high school student. So by staying at private homes--[foreign]By staying at private homes we can be intimate with the host family so we can-- plus it is difficult with [inaudible] host father or host mother but--[inaudible]Sorry. But we could be intimate with such host family so this is what studying is. But with my experience as high school student I stayed at hotel as my school trip. In my hotel-- being at hotel we just talked with my friend and we just eat snacks and we just watching TV in hotels. Therefore nothing to study in that situation. So there are nothing to study in such situation so there are no meaning to going to school trip. So we believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. Thank you. [applause]
Hello everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels for schools trips should not be banned. Let me summarize today's debate. The most important point is whether we can study more or not. On this point their idea is we can-- the teacher's have to take responsibility to protect students and students can be in danger. However students-- teachers can also make contact like calling the phones every night. So they can connect with students. And also students--[foreign]No thank you. And home stay has so many more chances to be independent because they spend all the time-- even sleeping time-- so before the [inaudible] teachers, students take the home before going with the--[foreign]No thank you. With the home it's [inaudible] appropriate or not. So the home safe. The school can check the safety. So it is not dangerous.[foreign]No thank you. And our argument is [inaudible] it is because school trip for learning new things and to find the true [inaudible]. But learning with connecting with local peoples. So we can connect with the people by asking the food or nature or history. And we can resolve the [inaudible]--[foreign]No thank you. [inaudible] like dialect. And we can learn the with the wristband or [inaudible]. So and we can help. We can help them like housework. So we can be independent. So because you're [inaudible]--Oh okay. So you say that people can be independent by this plan but why do we have to take dangerous way to make them independent?Could you say that again?Why do we have to take dangerous way like staying at the private home to make them independent?As I mentioned the private home is not dangerous. It is because the family can control them and before the trip the school has already checked the safety. So after [inaudible] the students will go to that trip. So it is not dangerous. So we believe that the house is safe. So we can [inaudible] the good point of private homes. So we [inaudible] this motion. Thank you. [applause]
Hello everyone. Today we believe that using private house as hotel for school trip should be banned. First I will rebut the opposition's second point. They say that during school trips students can learn the human relationships so it is good. However first of all we are talking about today is about a private house so not home staying and their second speaker said that I can make the good relationship between people. However it's maybe home stay. So we are saying that home stay and private house is completely different because private house is only to learn students only place where [inaudible] can sleep so not to provide food or good relationships. No it's not true. Only to place where students can sleep so home stays and private house are completely different. And also why can't the students can learn good relationships in field days because school trip is very short times so not so long times so why can't students-- normally we can say that only few days to we can-- students can--[foreign]No thank you. Students can create good relationships therefore your second point doesn't stand. 
I'd like to-- next I'd like to summarize today's debate. The most important point is that using private houses is good for children or not. On this point they say that students can learn a local food or way of thinking through staying at private house and we can learn about cultures-- can learn about the culture. However also we can learn about the local culture during or staying temple or visiting shrines so-- and also this learning is consisted by the safety conditions. So to be safe is very important. And also please look at our points. First of all what is school trip? During school trip teachers have to have responsibility to protect children and teachers rely on the-- no parents rely on teachers and they can left children for teachers. And also so the parents don't rely on the people who rent private houses so-- and also therefore our [inaudible] is very important. Therefore we propose [inaudible].
Everyone can manage the private hotels easily. So the security isn't too-- not strength. So in order to protect students, we should ban this motion. So that's why we proposed this motion. See? First of all, when we are [inaudible], so the private homes means the homes which are used as hotel and managed private individual. And school trips mean the students travel and they go to not only Japan, and also foreign countries. and this motion is taken for Japanese students. And it is different from home-stay, which we learn the culture or [inaudible]. So these are smaller. Today we have two points. The first point is protect students. And the second point is about the burden, and it will be explained by my partner. 
And I will explain the first point, which is protect students. In the current situation, everyone can't manage the private hotel easily because the criteria often is not so strict because the government promotes people to open private homes in order to solve the hotel shortage. So the criteria to open is not so strict. So the security isn't too-- not strict. And students can easily to be stolen, your things and so on. So we should protect students from such things. So even if--[inaudible]Yes, please.So often does problem occur?How often? Of course, the time is not so much, but the [inaudible] is more big than a big and famous hotel because the security is not so strict. So even if the teachers can choose the hotel by calling information, compared to the famous hotels, it is difficult for teachers to collect information on whether it is safe or not. Right? So teachers can prevent such crime, and so. And school trips is one of the school education. So city teachers have the most responsibility to protect students from crime. And also, imagine that if the students-- if you were a student and you go to the school trip, if you were stolen, your values, you will feel so sad. Right? However, that very sad memory will happen if we use private homes. So this motion is necessary to achieve the responsibility of education and protect students. So by banning this motion-- banning this private homes is the only way to protect students and achieve the educational aim. So we beg to propose. Thank you [applause].
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, chairperson. I'm the first speaker from the negative side. So let me start today's first speech. So first of all, let me recount on what the previous speaker has said. so they said school trips should be considered as a trip because of something, but I think that it is not true because school trip is for learning new styles of culture or learning new perspectives by traveling or going to other places or other part of the country. So because of that, they say that home-stay doesn't consider in this debate, but it should be considered in this debate because home-stay is one of the part-- some schools introduce home-stay in school trip and also to learn things. And so we should consider it.
And let me start my first argument. So my first argument is that in order to learn new cultures as by a school trip, private homes should not be banned. So if you go to school trip, you will find new foods or new customs or new perspectives because, for example, if you go to America as a school trip like my junior high school, you will learn new foods, for example, hamburgers, real hamburgers, or real mac and cheese, or so on. And you will find that Japanese food are totally different from that. And you will learn that Japan is better than America or you might think that America is better than Japan. But anyway, so you will learn new things. And so why is it important to learn those new things in school trip? Because--[inaudible]Yeah?What can say that other place, like not hotel, is not enough to learn something like culture?Ah, yeah. Thank you for asking. So hotel, we can order foods specific you like or you don't learn new customs because you will stay with your friend. And you will stay at a hotel, which is similar to your own living place. So you are not likely to learn new things in hotels. You are likely to learn new things--[inaudible]Sorry. And so let me explain why is it important. Because we meet with people who came from different places or culture. Like today, so for example, Osaka and Tokyo, you will meet together like today and so you sometimes get conflict with them or something like that. And so it is important to learn new things by school trips because we cannot learn those things by daily life. So from [inaudible] to learn new things, we should not ban private home to using in school trips. Thank you.
Private homes is run, not by big governing agents, such as company, but by individual. And in school trips, there are many student. They have many different characteristic. So [inaudible] student, the running system is not ensured to school trip in the private homes, therefore, that why we propose this motion today. First, let me rebut opposition's first point they say about learning new cultures. However, it is not true because there is no uniqueness in their point because we can, if we go to school trips, we can learn the many cultures in shops or also in hotels because, talking about in Japan, in hotels we can foreign people can eat Japanese food. Right? And also, foreign tourists can go to Japanese hotels and Japanese ryokan. So there is no uniqueness. Therefore, their point doesn't stand. 
And next, I'll reconstruct our first point. They say that home-stay should be included in this [inaudible], however, without home-stay, by going to the place, we can talk to native people. So there rebuttal has no reason-- enough reason. Therefore--[inaudible] information.Sorry. Therefore, our first point is too strong. 
Finally, I'll explain our second point. The big burden for runner. We believe that the running private homes as hotels for school trips is big burden for runner. In the present situation, ordinary hotels used in the school trips have many kinds of work. For example, creating food for students. In school trips, there are many students and they have different allergy of food. Big, ordinary hotels provide students with food in order to [serve?] each students, these kinds of hotels can do this service because they have stable, running system and they have enough employees. They have enough capacity. So they can do it. But in private homes, hotels, this service is big burden because, as I said, in school trips, it is very important to sort each student. And in school trips, the number of student is very big. So if allergy of food is provided to students, it is serious problem for students and schools. And also for runners of private hotels. But after the plan, these kinds of problems can be solved. So private companies burden will decrease. Therefore, we should take this plan. Thank you [applause].
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. So let me move onto any rebuttal the previous speaker has said. They said their first point was that the big burden to the runner. However, this is not matter of this debate because they are more likely to welcome those students from other areas because they want to support our regions by sight-seeing industries. So this is very beneficial to the regions and--Sir?No, thank you. So this is very beneficial to those regions and they can earn money. The regions can earn a lot of money. So the numbers of the students or something like that doesn't matter in this debate. And the negative side's point is more superior to government's side. [inaudible].Yes. For to bring the benefit, why is it not enough for the ordinary hotels?I'm sorry, [inaudible]. Could you say that again?Oh. Why isn't it enough to use ordinary hotels?I'm sorry. So I'll talk about later. And our second point of—
so let me move on to rebuttal. And so our point is more better than the government's side. So our side is win this debate. And the second point-- our second point is that the learning the people of the regions-- learning the people of the regions. So why this is important, because that we can not know that characteristic of those other regions. So in order to study those regions, they speak [inaudible] kind of language, any intonation and accent is not the same--Sir?--as our region, so. Thank you. So learning those things is better than government point because in the future, we have to work in this society. And we have to meet other kind of people so we have to study about that type of city or those other regions, other people from those regions. So this is very beneficial to visiting, using private homes as hotels. And why this is important, because as my partner said, and so this is very important because we have to learn about the diversity. And we can learn the special food in those homes because we don't know about that special food in Tokyo or Osaka. We can learn the Ireland food or Greenland food easily by using those private homes. So this is very important things to diversity. So those points, for those reasons, the opposition side could win this debate. Thank you [applause].
Thank you, moderator. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'm the third speaker from the negative side. I strongly believe that we should not take this motion. So let me summarize today's debate. The most important point is what student can learn through school trips. On this point, their idea was protection of students, which actually does not make sense. We believe that our argument is superior because we can let student learn lots of things through having private homes. So what the students can learn of? First of all, they said the school trip is a travel, but that is not true. We have a school trip to learn what we can't learn through our daily lives. So it is important to-- it is necessary to focus on what the students can learn through the school trip. And we believe that the private home is the best way to learn those things because they can learn the different daily life from their original life. And because everyone is going to be this society and everyone goes to have new environment, it is important to get used in those environments. So we believe that on this point, having private homes is very practical way to learn those things. And they have set it up, some kind of points, like allergies or something is going to become a problem, but we can check before having a school trip. And it is really easy. And we can prevent those kind of troubles so their point does not stand. And also, they have said that because the criteria is a little bit weak than ordinary hotels, robbery or something would happen. But their logic was not enough to explain those things. We couldn't understand why the criteria is low or something. And such kind of troubles would not happen, we believe. So what the world that the government side have mentioned would not happen. We believe that would not happen. And if you compare these two things, because students can learn lots of things by having private homes, we believe that the negative side won on this debate. And we strongly believe that we should not take this motion. Thank you [applause].
School trip is not amusement, it is a part of education in schools. So there is always exists schools responsibilities to protect the students from dangerous things such as theft and allergy and so on. School has to do it, but in private homes, it sometimes has difficulty to achieve it. And this [prosperity?] occurs such things in higher than normal hotel, which private hotel will-- sorry. The school will expose children in danger, that is why we propose this motion today. First, I direct to rebut your second argument. They say that learning diversity is important. However, normal hotel's capacity is larger than private hotels. It means that we can meet more people and it allows us to learn diversity. Also, they didn't say why private homes allows us to learn diversity enough. And not all students want to learn diversity, but all students aren't committed crimes. Therefore, their standard argument doesn't stand.
The most important point in this debate is which [inaudible] is more important for schools in school trip; children's safety or learning something about the place? On this point, they claim that the latter is more important because of these reasons. Because learning about things is very useful for students, however, it is not important as it is very un-unique. The second speaker say that students can experience different culture, such as in shops and also, there are many people food of the region in ordinary hotels. And there are other kinds of traditional hotels. So not in private hotels, they can learn something about the unique things in the area. So their argument doesn't stand. It is not unique. And also, they didn't attack anything about our first point about security. And they claimed that the runners want to protect the industry. [And nothing to it?] Do they want to protect-- do they want to protect their culture? It is not true, so therefore, their argument doesn't stand. However, our argument is superior. And we claim that protecting students is the most important point. Basically, school trip is under the education. And students must be - oh, sorry; No, thank you - under the safe environment. So even if they can learn unique things in the areas, difficulty that it creates was to occur, it would be the worst trip for students. Right? So it is not true as things. And it is not useful to this. Therefore, we oppose this-- sorry. Therefore, we propose this motion. Thank you [applause].


Hello, everyone.Today's topic is using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. We have two points. The first point is the owner of these hotels can't take responsibility. Second point is making students stay different hotels maybe unequality. 
I'll will explain the first point. The owner of these hotels can't take responsibility. I have one reason, because they aren't professional. These of normal hotels are professional so they educated how to take responsibility. But this private homes are not thorough, so maybe they don't know how to deal with some troubles.[inaudible]?Okay.Can you tell me detail of the trouble? You said trouble. What do mean of trouble? Give me example, please.Maybe some of the students fall of peels for banana, throw peels. They may allergies or they hurt themselves. So when the normal-- when the owner-- when the owner looked at them, I think they will be very-- okay.Thank you. Okay. I think that responsibility should be taken by teachers because they are taking them to school. They [inaudible] at hotels or houses. Or how do you think about this point?In the school, there are lot of students but very little teachers. So it's impossible to all responsibility by teachers. [inaudible] my opinion. And students, when they go a school trip, they must make a fuss. And I think it's very likely that they make troubles such as-- that's all. Thank you.
Hi, everyone.We believe that using private homes for hotels for school trip should not be banned. Let me rebut what the government team said. They said the hotels are not professional so they can't-- they are not professional, but they take a children to them for a while, so they explain about-- they explain-- they are professional. So therefore their argument is not strong. 
And let me explain our point. We have two points. The first point is get a great experience. The second point is students can feel that they are member of family. I will explain the first point, get a great experience. We believe that we can go to good experience to use private homes as hotel for school trip. For example, I have sister. She visited local family in Okinawa. She cooked traditional food and so she said it was so fun. So if she used the normal hotel, she couldn't experience the real--[inaudible].No thank you. The real [inaudible] Okinawa. Maybe she just stay normal hotel, it can-- if she just stay normal hotel, it is not special experience. So because we can explains other place, not only Okinawa, because it's normal for them. So if we use private homes as hotel, we can explains traditional in those place. So [inaudible] we should not ban this trend. Thank you.
Hello everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. First, let me rebut opposition's first point. They said that staying at private home would be a great experience. For example, they would be able to cook food. However, it's always possible to experience their culture through visits and planned programs. It doesn't always have to be in a local's home. For example, let me use your example. To cook food, they could always visit a home or visit a class. Or I would assume that they visiting a place that is full of culture, there would be programs where they can experience their culture. So therefore, the opposition's first point is not always true. 
Next, let me reconstruct the government's first point. They said that they've been doing-- that the owners of these homes have doing this for a long time, so they are pros in their own ways. However, there are always first timers, and you never know what's going to happen. Experienced drivers still get into accidents, and experienced pilots still face malfunctions.Point.Yes.So you mean the experience cannot mean they're no accident. However, so you mean that the experienced hotel man or experienced hotel staff, can make accident. Right?Yeah.Okay. Thank you.I'm not going to deny the fact that professionals also get involved in accidents. But people who have really studied something and have much more experience than a person who is at best a local, right, it's just fact and knowledge that the risk are different. Right? They're pros and they are pros. There's a difference. 
Now let me explain our second point. Making students stay at different houses with different facilities would be unfair to some of them. We believe that-- sorry. Some houses may have a large bath, and some may have several toilets, and some may have a large garden to play. But some may not have any of these. This would obviously be unfair to the students who don't have access to these facilities. Chances are that the students have all paid the same price to be there on that school trip. And yet that some students wouldn't have access to these facilities that others do is unfair and, honestly, might even drag the students apart. I might break their bonds that they've nurtured over their years that they spent together. A better example would be, say that one house has a large room and a table and a light that they can study under at night. Or maybe the owners of the house would have games or card games or board games that they could all play with and nurture their bond with. And yet, some houses may not have that, and obviously, that'd be very unfair and that they wouldn't be able to communicate with each other as the people who do have that would. Therefore we believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned.Okay. Thank you.That was easy.
Oh, okay. So hello everyone. I'm [inaudible], and we believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. Let me rebut government's first point. They said the owner cannot take responsibility because they're not professional. However they can take responsibility because before they're-- before we say that, "Oh, they're not hotel man," but we can say that they're a member of society, and they're an adult, so they can deal with the troubles in their daily lives. They can deal with troubles that occur in our daily life. So they can take responsibility as an adult. Therefore your argument does not stand. 
As for government's second point, it's unfair for students to stay different home, and we should make it same, exact same for other students. However, I think that-- now, previous situation-- no, present situation, many students who participate in school trip take another courses such, "Oh, I go this way, and I go to swim in Okinawa." Or other student, "Oh, I want to learn history, so I can go there." So make exact same thing does not mean that it is truly good. But make the difference of the students can make students independency and also make students more diversity. So we can encourage diversity through make differences between students. Therefore-- no, thank you. I'm sorry, I don't have time. So I think that's not good point.
And next, let me reconstruct opposition's first point. They said program can include special program such as cooking food or something. However, that's not special. We mean, special programs means that the experience that only local people know or only local-- experience that local people usually do. So local people's daily lives cannot experience through these special programs like programs special experience. So I think it's not the same. 
Then let me explain our second point. A student can feel like they're a member this family. We believe that students and families become good friends like real family. Please imagine, you stayed at the private home during your school trip. Your host mother is totally different from hotel staff because she doesn't have another customers as the hotel do, but just you. They have just you. So she smiles and welcomes you like, "Welcome back. Welcome back to Okinawa. Welcome back to the place." So you must feel like you get another home. It's precious. And no one who stays at the hotel can never experience it, can never experience getting another family in distant city. It can support students when they in trouble or when they have hard time. This is very [inaudible]. I believe that this is good. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. Okay. We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. Let me summarize today's debate. The most important point is that we can make unforgettable memories and also our second home too. And on this point their idea is that we can experience those things in other places and public houses too, and that it would not be public home's owners would not be able to take responsibility, and it will be unequal. However, our argument is superior. It is because we not going to school trips to just sightseeing or to just receive some services like local food cooking. We are to there to increase our knowledge, be more smarter, and experience something that we cannot experience through sightseeing. So I think that, let me explain. For example, if we cannot ride a bike and we want to be able to ride a bike, we don't just see at it or don't just study at it. We can ride it. So we can experience its local system, how it goes and who [inaudible]. And then we would be able to know about Kyoto, Okinawa and the local area. And also, I don't think that what matters is not a big house-- or not in a big house you live in or a small house, or with a big bath or with a small bath. The most important point is that how many you can learn from that family, how that family is smart, or how can you be smarter through living there. So therefore our argument is superior and their rebut doesn't stand. And therefore we believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. Thank you, [inaudible].
Hello everyone, we believe that using private home as hotel for school trips should be banned. First, let me rebut opposition's second point. You said we can feel like a member of a family, but I think we aren't able to feel a member of the family by staying only one or two or three days because they only sleep. Having an experience in the nature in the daytime will be better than only sleeping or taking a bath in the same house. And so I think-- and they said they are responsible, they at the hotel have the responsibility, but a house hasn't responsibility. But even, there at the house, they can matter about daily life, I think they can-- they aren't still responsible because what is [inaudible] for? There are many [inaudible] that can't think about themselves. So I think they can't matter about other school students coming from other places. 
Next-- then I will summarize today's debate. The most important thing, the most important point is what's the real value of school trips are. On this point, their idea is they can learn different things, but I think the most important thing of school trips is to strengthen the student's ties. And we can't do it [inaudible] in separated places. And that means that something that learned, they feel is different, so we should discuss what we learn in the nature, so I think to actually achieve the real goal of school trip, we should ban using private homes as a hotel for school trip. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. Today's topic is using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. We [defined?] that students under 18 years old will use private homes as hotels in Japan. We have two points. The first point is private homes cannot take enough responsibility if something goes wrong. And the second point is that we have to worry about each other. 
I will explain the first point on private homes cannot take enough responsibility if something goes wrong. Private homes-- I mean, if I were a parent of the student, I'll be very worried of letting our children staying in private homes because it's private and they are not private-- I mean, private homes are not companies or organizations, so security wouldn't be reliable and [inaudible] security is the most important thing that we-- I mean, everybody cares about that. And there should be caretaker all the time in the private house but I don't think there is always a caretaker because it's the good point that you can feel at home in a real home by staying private homes. So therefore, using privates homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Thank you. [applause]
Hello, everyone.Today we sternly oppose this motion. First, let me rebut what the government team said. They said private homes can't have enough responsibility because it's private, however most of the schools have to research deeply about the private home so that doesn't really matter. And if they go to the private home, teacher can see the home so teacher can monitor the home so the accident will not often happen. And they said we can experience such private things and many experience at home, their home, but it's not all the student. So a student need to experience such things so we think that their argument does not stand. 
And next let me move on to our points. We have two points. The first point, it's good for students. The second point is good for people to accept students.I will explain the first point, good for students. Students can experience in ordinary things. For example, seeing many insects and nature and communicate with owner. They feel more close to their owner than hotel and they feel familiar to them, and then a private home is cheaper than hotel and so students can experience more things and activities by [conservating?] the cost. So they can get more skills than hotels, so that is good for students and students can know various things. For example, dialect of the private home and the lifestyle that is traditional culture. We have to [inaudible] traditional culture and think about the--[inaudible].Okay.Is there any evidence that-- I'm sorry. Is there any evidence that private homes are cheaper than hotels?We think that homes are cheaper than hotels and--But--I'm sorry.--and hotels have to pay more money to other securities and--Services.--services so that is more cost, so that we think that hotels more than cost. And [inaudible] the people who think about the culture, we can protect the [inaudible] culture. So that is good for Japanese society. And there are gap between the urban and countryside so to improve [inaudible] we must not take this motion. And we have to think about the problem of the gap of our city [inaudible] and countryside. So make much better society, we must not take this motion forth. We strongly oppose this motion. Thank you. [applause]
Hello, everyone. We believe that using private homes for school trips should be banned. Let me rebut opposition's first point. They said that it's good for students. However, I don't believe that is true. It is because, as they said, hotels have more security and service because we pay more for it. And I think that's actually better because if we pay more, we get more service, and I think our life is the most important thing, and I don't think that we should waste risking our life just to stay at hotel-- I mean, sorry, stay at private homes. And also they said that we can learn dialect by staying at private homes. However, we can talk with people working in stores or maybe sightseeing spots and asking them questions, and I think that's a more outgoing way to communicate with the people living there. 
Next, let me reconstruct government's second point. They said that the teachers research deeply about the private homes. However, we can't fully agree that the private homes are safe because these days there are mothers who kill their own children and high school students killing their whole family. And families, we trust each other very deeply but those accidents actually happen. So we can't 100% guarantee that private homes are safe.
The let me explain our second point. We have to worry about each other. At stations and sightseeing spots we see groups of students from elementary school to high school students in humongous groups just walking together, and don't they bother you? You might say they won't bother you but in my opinion, they really do bother me, and they're going to private homes which will be a really big burden to the people living there. And also the students like to stay up late when they go to school trips because their tension is high and they want to do a lot of things, and that's going to be kind of annoying to the people living there. And the students also have to worry about the people living there. And from my experience, students like to talk about things and secrets that you can't do at school when they go to school trips because it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. But if the people living in private homes have special activities set for them, we won't have time to do those talks, and those talks are kind of the reason we get more deeply into our relationship with our friends so I believe those things are needed. Therefore, I believe that using private homes for school trips should be banned. Thank you.
Yes. Hello, everyone. We believe that-- we strongly oppose this motion. First, let me explain our second point. Our second point is for people who has to accept students. We have three reasons. First reason is contact with different generation. And second reason, they can tell that a characteristic of land. Third, money. I will explain our first reason. If you take the people who accept the students can contact with different generations, they can learn other viewpoint from the student and [whole different?] trend and opinion. For example, the [inaudible] elderly. They can't know new trend and [inaudible] and it makes them a good life because they can't enjoy a TV show or [inaudible] or a [question?]. It's good for elderly because they here are maybe boring for lifestyle, a life, and they can use and introducing [next?] opinion. For example, exhibit A, they can know how students sing, a younger, and-- yes?Let me explain the second reason. They can share the characteristic of land. For example, local dish or lifestyle of the people will [inaudible] accept the student want to know the characteristic of land. The students can eat home, original, local food and it makes the understanding of [locale?], and the local people want to know and please want us to tell our good point so they can tell the good point. And their second [inaudible]. There is a lot of merit, I [experienced?] and also they can get [inaudible]. It's good.
And I will reconstruct our first point. Now there is a website people can give evaluation and, for example, F rank or A rank or B rank and schools can choose good [inaudible]. And also, mostly school used private hotel every year, so there is a relationship between the school and private [residence?] and I connect that [inaudible] and therefore we should [inaudible]. [applause]
Hello, everyone. This topic is using private homes as hotels for student [inaudible]. Let us summarize today's debate. The most important point is, close relationship between manager and tourist. On this point, they said, "Oh, what is most important thing?" However, there are other-- the internet site which divide private homes in [inaudible] by the safety level, and we can measure how safety it is by the site on internet and we can say that hotel can completely have responsibility of the safety, and so your opinion doesn't stand. And in the first place, the meaning of doing school trip is that by linking the [inaudible], for example, with the same temple and shrines, we can [inaudible] history and the custom of the historical [inaudible]. That is to say, it means that we can [inaudible] that [distriction?] and we can make [inaudible] atmosphere. In other words, custom and culture deeply. And of course, in certain conditions we-- certain conditions exist but on this portion we think that we shouldn't ban, and it is the freedom of choice of hotel or using a private [house?].And we have two merits of having close relationship. First is tourists can discover the new realization about the custom. For example, the way of talking of the people of this [distriction?] as how nice and other people of this [distriction?] have such a nice way of living. And second is that a tourist can communicate with other generation people, and so it is good for their quality of life and [inaudible]. Therefore, we strongly against this motion. Thank you. [applause]
Hello, everyone. We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Let me rebut opposition's second point. They said that students can take contact with different generation.[inaudible]. We say that people who has accepted students can [inaudible].[inaudible].And so they also said that the people on the [inaudible] can hear something from the younger ones but it's just that we are thinking that they want to know such things, but they may not want to know those things. And second, they said they can tell the characteristics of [inaudible] and certain food, but we can also eat such things at hotels or something that you go with during your trip. There's [inaudible] like that. So it doesn't have to be the private home. And third, they said about the money, but also they said that every year the schools can use the private homes. But using the same place every year would be a big burden for the families accepting the students.But the private hotel can choose whether accept the students or not, so it's not [inaudible]--But if the private homes doesn't want to accept anymore, then schools have to search for another place and that will be a lot of work for the school, so it is better to use hotels. 
Then I also [inaudible] the most important point is students, parents, and the people accepting the students have fun and feel good. On this point, their idea is students can learn from the owner and the people who accept students can learn as well. However, our argument is [inaudible]. It is the most important thing is the safety of the students, and we should not risk the safety for such things because we can also learn many things by talking to people at stations or [scene?] spots and there are many other chances that we can learn the things. And so therefore using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Thank you.


Why we have to introduce this motion? Because to protect student safety, it is the best choice to introduce that. That's why we strongly propose this motion. First, [I will define it] as a motion. This motion for in Japan's, and government will be banned all private homes as hotels. 
Next, I'll explain our first point. Our first point is for protect student safety, and our second point is ability to take the responsibility of private homes. I'll explain our first point. Our first point is protect student safety. First of all, what is the difference between the hotels and private homes as hotels? It is that possibility to commit connected crimes. The hotels have guaranteed to prevent any crimes by employees because if employees commit crimes, the hotel have to [inaudible] and the evaluation will be down and decreasing. So hotels give educations not to commit-- not to some crimes or the hotels ask the employees to not do any crimes or something that [inaudible] before they fires. But however, the homes as hotels owners have a high possibility to commit crimes because schools cannot research who owner is safety or not. Some schools have a lot of children, more than 400 students or 500 students and so on. So the school have to use a lot of homes as hotels because of big numbers. So the school cannot research how it is safety or have a possibility to crimes by the owners. [To put it?] in situations, the schools have no guarantee to protect the students' safety because of the high possibility of the-- no, thank you, high possibility to commit crimes by owners [inaudible] only hotels can be used by the school trip. And the school can research which hotel is safety or not because if use only hotels, all students can use only one hotels. So it is easy to research. And it is more clearly safety for student safety. The government have to protect students or students' safety by taking this grant. That's why we strongly propose this motion. Thank you.
Let's begin the first speech from the opponents' side. We strongly believe that using private homes as hotels should not be banned. First of all, let me refer to what the previous speaker has said. She say that by using private home as hotel is dangerous for student because teachers can't research it at all, but it not true because-- now, first of all, there is a question, what kind of crime does private homeowner commit? It's unclear. And why do those owners commit crime? There are no reason. So the possibility is also low, and also why do we have to ban those kind of private homes? There are lots of kind owners. Also, all the private homes owner is not such dangerous, and why do we have to ban those owners then? 
Let me explain our argument. We have two arguments. First one is using private homes students can learn the culture. And second, using private home, student can learn how to live in communities. So let me explain our first arguments. What is the purpose of school trip? Of course, one is education, but it isn't only the reason but also learn culture or learn how they live in that location. So using private home, what kind of thing student can learn? It is that how those residents live or how those residents eating.Point?Yes.So if the student have to learn these area the cultures, why it is not enough to stay in the Japanese-style hotels? It is Japanese traditional home.[inaudible] hotel and private home is apparently clearly different because the hotel is made to invite many visitors but private home is just living they want to do. So it's clearly different. During the school trip, student can learn also the famous temple or famous beautiful mountain. But it's not only the purpose of school trip but also how do they live in-- how are they actually living or how are they actually eating is important because it is also the purpose of school trip. And also, for example, Okinawa, which is the closest prefecture, and the culture is quite different from other prefectures. So during using private home as hotels, student can learn those things. Of course, [inaudible] student can do so. Thank you.
Their side cannot guarantee the safety of using private homes as hotels. So their argument does not-- so their point does not stand. 
So first, let me [debate?] what the opposition side said. They just said about we didn't explain--Point?No, thank you, we didn't explain about what kind of crime will happen, but there is high possibility of occurring the sex crime because people will [inaudible] the-- people of using private homes as hotels will [inaudible] girls because the sex crime is not reducing in the world. So it is enough reason to occurring the sex crime even if using private homes as hotels because by using private homes as hotels, the owners can see their-- and so people will [inaudible] girl. So it is so high possibility to occur in the sex crime. So our point is standing. And they said about the first point about the learn the--Point?--no, thank you, about learning the culture because they didn't explain the uniqueness of private homes because the Japanese-style hotel have traditional services such as washoku or [inaudible]. So Japanese-style hotel is more good to learn about the tradition of such prefecture. And so such hotel is educated to tell the tradition for all people. So using hotels for school trips is more superior to using private homes as hotels. So the argument does not stand. 
So moving on to our point, our point is ability is to take less responsibility of private homes. So in emergency case, private homes do not have enough ability to take responsibility. Hotels' employees have received enough education in emergency such as [inaudible]. Hotels' employee can measure it properly because they have received enough education to help guests by experts. So the hotels have to [inaudible] to take the education to help guests who [inaudible]. So hotels can many countermeasures to such emergency situation appropriately and prompt. They can countermeasure it the proper and prompt measure, so. However, private homes as hotels obviously cannot take proper and prompt measure. So even if the opposition side said giving education for private homes as hotels is enough, we cannot completely give the education private homes because as the first speaker told you, a school have so many students, such as 400 students. So to using private homes, schools have to educate 400 private homes. So it is so unrealistic to educate completely for private homes. So in emergency cases, private homes cannot take proper and prompt measure for all citizens. So the student safety is not guaranteed. So this why we strongly propose this motion. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. Let me begin my speech. First, let me refer to what in their first argument. In their first argument, they said that a private home have possibility to commit crime. However, this is not true because if they, owner, commit crime it is clear that they cannot able to invite students. So the possibility is very low. What is more [inaudible] happens, it doesn't have uniqueness to private homes. It can be [inaudible] in hotel too. So we believe that hotels is more dangerous because hotels have--[crosstalk]?No, thank you, hotels have more people in the hotel. So you don't know the people who stay at the hotel. Such people can commit crime at the point that such people have-- the number of such people is big in the hotel we can say that hotel have--[crosstalk]?--much more possibility to commit crimes. Yes, please.So hotels' employee cannot commit crime, but owner can commit crime because the owner's room and the student's room are so near. So what do you think about that?I didn't say that the employee on the hotel. I said that people who stay at the hotel for their purpose. They may commit crimes such as sex crime as they said, but we cannot investigate such people are in the hotel or not. No, thank you. 
So let me refer to their second argument. In their second argument, they said that we as hotel owners cannot help children in emergency. However, this is not true. If we educate-- if you give license to people who run private home and if they are such-- if we educate them, we can say that they are only people who know how to--Point?--how to give them opportunity or to escape from the emergency. No, thank you. So we can say that it is not true.Point?No, thank you. 
Then let me [inaudible] our first argument. They said that there is no uniqueness in private home. However, this is totally different because as our first speaker said, hotel are made to invite people. However, private home reflect their lifestyle, such as Shirakawa zukuri. In such home, you can know how warm it is or how they are made and we can learn such culture. 
Let me tell our second argument. Our second argument that student can learn how to live in community. Some students live in dormitory, such as strong baseball club. It is because that they can learn a sense of unity. If we are going to give such opportunity to all students, how can they learn how to live in the-- how can they learn a sense of unity? Living in one house is totally different from living in personally. They have to think of others. They may sleep in same time day.Point?They cannot make noise. No, thank you. And so they can learn it. Then why is it important? It is important because-- thank you [laughter].
Hello, everyone. The most important thing is which is better for students. So let me explain this point. They said that using private home is dangerous because school cannot research. However, it is not true. As my partner said, a owner will not commit crime. So the possibility is low. On the other hand, as we said, the student can learn much more things, for example, the culture or social skills. The culture is, as he said, the structure of houses or the [inaudible] or something like that. So it is the valuable experience for students. And the social skill, why is it important? We have to live in harmony in many situation. As for schools, schools' duty is to educate children, not only study but also learning social skills especially for school trips. So in ordinary school life, student cannot learn such a thing. So students can learn these things only in school trips. And in a private home, students can learn these things. And also, why do we have to ban? Some owners are kind. So we don't have to ban. And we strongly believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. Thank you.
What the school should do for student to protect the student's safety. Even if student can learn many things by using private hotel, the school should protect the student from any accident. That why we strongly propose this motion. First, I go back to their second point. They said about the children how to learn living in community, but why student have to use private hotel on their school trips? For that purpose, the students can use private homes with their parents. So using private hotel only by student is so dangerous as our speaker told you that. So their second argument propose the student can't use the system with their parents. So their argument is not standing. 
And I need to talk about today's important point. Today's important point is the first, what culture student can learn on the school trips and the second, the why the private hotel is dangerous and why government can't guarantee the students' safety by using the private hotel. The first I will explain. What if the student can learn by school trips the culture or the lifestyle or something like that. However, why student can learn this culture by only using private hotel they didn't explain. And moreover, the student can learn culture by using hotel as our second speaker told you. So even if government take this plan, the student can learn culture. So their argument is not standing and our argument is superior. The second, the why the private hotel is dangerous and why government can't guarantee the student safety. The first case is the crime. They can't say that all owner of private hotel are safety because the government can't check that all of owners are safe or not. And moreover, the government can't check the reasons of why they become owners. So government can't guarantee the student safety by using private hotels. And second case is the emergencies. If emergency occurred, private hotels' owner can't respond because they didn't know what dangerous or what they can do for them. So their argument is not standing. So our argument is superior, and the government should protect the students safety. So that why we strongly propose this motion. Thank you.
Hello, everyone.Today's topic is using private homes as hotel for student school trips should be banned. We define the motion as follows. Only elementary students study in Japan. And their teacher and their parents don't stay at private homes with the elementary students. [inaudible] this up. And we have two points. The first point is that it is dangerous for staying students. The second point is they are--Immature.--immature. 
I will explain the first points that it is danger for staying students. First, private homes is different service and safety. For examples, one company [build?] itself a private homes for visitors and I heard their service is good. However, one private homes provide food which has food poison in [inaudible] and don't know allergy foods. And the visitor--Why can't you say, "Only a private home has the poison food or something?Well--Why only private homes has poisonous food? [inaudible].Oh, okay. No, sorry. Next speakers answers. Come in now. And the visitors ate it then and he was sent from a hospital and it [inaudible] at the newspapers. And so provide homes that's good and should check the private homes is[Point?]?--no secure? Good or bad. And so it is a problem for students and teachers. And recently, private homes are bad. So the government makes a law of private homes--Point.No, thank you.[inaudible].[inaudible]. Homes and [inaudible]. So the law, it can't make perfect.[Sir?]?No, thank you. And so that's the problem. It is dangerous too. So my problem is the school and the teacher should think about the teachers' and students' safety. And therefore using private homes as hotel for school trips should be banned. Thank you.
Okay. So what is school trip? School is where students can learn something that they can't learn at school. Through [this?] field trip, they can actually see with their own eyes, own ears and communicate with local people, interact with local people, and that is the point of school trip. So now I want to move on through the verification and get it to the Prime Minister of the government side. So he mentioned that it's very dangerous for elementary students to stay at private homes. However, there's no uniqueness to the private homes. Since there is some person has accident or crimes at hotels as well. And also, if it's that dangerous for students, then why would you limit to elementary students? And also, if we can solve this by alternative ways such as give then criteria or license or a test for private homes same as the hotels.
Now, I will like to move on to my point. So our [team stance?] today is diverse experience. So now, we have two points. First one is comprehensive experience and second point is experience countryside. So now I will like to talk about the first point. So there are things that they can only experience at private homes. So for example, they can communicate and interact with local people only in private homes. For example, they can learn how they spend their night, for example, the dinner, what they eat. Or in city like us, we spend night by studying or using our phones. However, local people might be different from them, right? And you can learn that only through staying private homes. However, if you stay at hotels, they can't learn these different culture or diverse culture. And these students can create their own world by using smartphone or talking something in their community which is no difference from their usual life, right?And therefore, the educational intent of school trip cannot be achieved by school trip which has no meaning of the private school. Therefore, we believe that if we take this motion, these students cannot learn much from the school trip which school's intend students to be learning. So, therefore, we believe that it is very educational crisis because school trip is very important for students to learn and experience something new through their eyes and their own ears. However, by taking this motion, these students cannot experience new things. Thank you.

We believe that using private home as hotels for student should be banned. Let me rebut a [official's?] first point. They say they can't learn a lot of things in the school. However, it has not private school-- if it was not private home, they can't communicate to local people. For example, talking something or asking something, it is very meaningful. Therefore, using private school--Home.--as homes for school trips should be banned. 
Next, let me deconstruct government's first point. They said they have license. However, private homes are not safe enough because it has [land?] and managed by individual. But hotels are not. So hotels are more safe. Therefore using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. 
Then, let me explain our second point. They are too immature. We believe that they have not grown up. They have not grown up enough. So they can't take responsibility their own powers. There are no teacher and their parents. If it was hotel, they can tell what happened for them to their teacher.Point of information is in the age of smartphones, why can't they report to their teacher using their phone or simply call the police if something bad happens?So if the students don't have a smartphone, they can't contact with their teacher. Also, they don't have enough communication ability. For example, their friend was bad. However, they can't tell you about it enough. After school trip, if they were harmed, they was very, heavy sick. And who have responsibility if they are too immature to use private house as a hotels for school trip. Therefore, using private homes as hotels school trips should be banned. Thank you.
School trips exist to expose students that the world exists outside of their narrow perspective, right? When you're in an urban school, you go to see rural areas because there's another world out there. And they provide that invaluable opportunity. With that said, our stance for today was diverse experience. And I'm going to be talking about how students have to experience the countryside. But before that, some [inaudible]. First, towards the first speaker. They talked about how it's dangerous, right? We told you that we would hold these homes to the same standard as hotels, therefore, maximizing safety.Also, it's not unique to private homes. Hotels have the same danger. Towards their refute towards first about alternatives, they have not refuted that private homes are-- to our fact that private homes are a comprehensive experience, right? They haven't told us how field work will allow students to learn about climate, the culture, the architecture. All of those things you can only gain by actually living in the same style of the local person. We think that's a unique benefit to our side.
Now, to their first point-- to their second point about immaturity, we think that there is a very low possibility of danger because their interests are aligned for both private homes and for students, right? The private homes are being paid to protect these students. Therefore, they're going to maximize their effort to do that. And the students want to stay safe as well, right? We think that as long as these interests are aligned, these homeowners will do everything in their power to keep students safe. And we think that because it has worked so well in the past for Japanese schools, it will work well in the future. And because they haven't given us any examples, we don't have sufficient reason to believe it will be bad.
Moving on to my point about how experiencing countryside is important. Banning private homes would limit school trips to cities and narrow student perspective. In the sphere of scope, private homes are used for trips to rural areas without hotels, right? For example, in Shibu, Shibu students go to a very small city-- not a city, very small village in Kyushu to live with a farmer and learn about the effort behind making rice because that is an experience that you cannot get in the middle of Shibuya. And without that experience, we would grow up without knowing how difficult it is to make one piece of rice. That experience shapes our worldview and makes us believe that rural places are important.However, in their after plan, schools can only go to cities with hotels so like Tokyo and Osaka, right? There's going to be no more trips to the little villages in Kyushu. As a result, students cannot learn about rural areas. And we think that it's especially important to do this in the elementary school age because we need to create this basis of knowledge in their minds that rural places. They do important work like agriculture.We think that this leads to two detrimental effects. First, it alienates rural areas especially in urban students like us. When these students later become politicians or business owners, they're going to make decisions that only benefit urban places because they don't know about rural places. This is especially bad when Japanese rural areas are already in decline. Right? It's especially that.Second, it eliminates income for rural families who rely on this business to keep them alive when they're not farming, for example. We think that in the end, it's going to be neglecting the majority of the population who live in rural areas. And it's going to suffocate the already-suffering rural areas of Japan. Thank you.
Oh, sorry. Okay. So our two stance for today was diverse experience and first point was comprehensive experience and the second point was, what?Experience countryside.Experience the countryside. And so today I have one question which was unique issue. So opposition side has-- oh, sorry. The woman's side mention about the dangerous and immaturity. So we prove that their government side issue was not unique to only private homes because this issue is already happening in hotels. And by giving them enough lessons or criteria to private school, so it's kind of proven. So this problem is not unique. And immaturity, as my second speaker has said, between student private school-- oh sorry, private homes, there is mutual contract. So private homes are already paid to be responsible to their student. So this problem won't being happen.So second one on our point, we proved that the experience of school trips can give student a very precious experience because the experience of local is only they can experience as the local area. And a school trip is that. And this can be achieved only by interacting with local people especially by knowing local lifestyle. So as my first speaker has said, communicating and listening to local story with the people of private homes-- so on this point, what we said is only we can experience staying at a private homes. That why we want to say we don't want take this motion. Thank you.
Hello everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. First, let me rebut the opposition second point. They said a student can learn a lot of things through spend time rural area. However, they don't have to have good experience like the school trip. They can learn about that when they become adult or they can go there with their parents. Therefore, private homes as hotels for school trip should be banned.
Then, I will summarize today debates. The most important point is using private home as hotels for school trip can make a lot of serious problems and even make for some children and people of this come endangered. On this point, the idea is school trips' purpose is to learn communication and food and so on at private home. Sorry. And hotel can be dangerous as well. However, our argument is superior. It is because using private homes as hotels for school trip can be bad for both elementary student and people who run their home as hotels.Point. How do children get the unique countryside experience only going to large cities in school trips?I will talk about later. First of all, for students, it must be dangerous. Even they don't know the dangers. And the danger at the hotel must be much fewer. The law for using private homes as schools is not enough. You said that private homes get licenses, but one website has 50% more private homes which don't have license. Government don't decide to punish this private home. And you said it's the kind of learning. That's true. But the benefit is much fewer than the safe. The children's safety is the most important thing. And their experience can be did after they becoming adult and they can go with parents. And therefore, using private homes as hotels for school trip should be banned. Thank you.

Hello, everyone. Today's topic is using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. We define that the target school is junior high school in Japan. We have two points. The first point is manner trouble, manner trouble. The second point is part of [inaudible], part of [inaudible]. 
I will explain the first point, manner trouble. Most schools because they stay one night for students to-- students. But most junior high school students are lacking in manners, like judgment and responsibility.Point that we are missing. Point that we are missing. And it said it is bad manner for student. However, students, they're learn about manners by staying at private hotels. So what they are [inaudible].In our experience, we don't call the [inaudible] before to stay, so it is doubtful. Most students' lack of responsibility or society manners might become-- they sometimes cause [inaudible] when it becomes worse, and they [inaudible] need other or more [inaudible], more [inaudible] results. It gives trouble to school and their parents and the owner too. The owner when it become, it need to be [inaudible] because the owner have [inaudible]. It, be in trouble. So, therefore, using--But how trouble will come?Example is an [inaudible]. Therefore, using private homes as schools for school trips should be banned. Thank you.
Thank you. Today's motion is using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Let me explain our first argument. Our first argument is we cannot allow those things. We cannot allow those things. [inaudible] situation now since school entered this private homes as hotels for school trips, so they can [inaudible]. However, on the other hand, other schools stay hotels for school trips so they can't [inaudible] those things because they didn't have opportunities to communicate with other people and so on. So if we take this plan, the student can't use private homes as hotels for schools trips, should it be trips. So student can't learn a lot of things, such as their life, or nature, relationship between students and other people. So if the [inaudible] bad, in our school, they're not really become high school second students. They will go to-- okay, [inaudible] for school trips, and the weekend experience, a good experience, using private homes as hotels for school trip.So my senior, my senior is saying to me it is a very good experience because they can learn a lot of things from using private homes as hotels because they can communicate with the host or other people and figure out their life and so on [inaudible]. So if we don't take this plan, the students can't use this skill for other school rights in their school rights. So now, the opportunity to communicate other people will be super easy. So for this reason, we believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Thank you.
Hello, everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. First, let me [inaudible] first point. This is we can learn a lot of things by using private homes. However, it is not important because junior high school students can learn even they don't use private homes. For example, if I and by experience of agriculture or fishing. Also, junior high school students can communicate with local people while doing agriculture or fishing and so on.
[inaudible] question. Can [inaudible] say that the junior high school students can learn also the home style or kind of [inaudible] agriculture or kind of that?Sorry, I can't-- [inaudible] contract [inaudible]. But they don't recontract, so we can't. 
Then let me explain our second point, [inaudible]. We believe that private homes' [inaudible] is not always great because yeah, not many private homes [inaudible]. And junior high school students [inaudible] private homes and eat their local food. Surely, this experience is being experienced, such as is fun, because we can't always experience it. However, we can see the possibility to prevent germs in food. If infection spread to junior high school students, we can see the possibility of group infection, and then the school trip, we think, school trip should be banned. So even if the junior high school students can [inaudible] of infection, [inaudible] is limited. Also, junior high school students [inaudible] know always about their [inaudible]. It's limited. So, therefore, we believe that-- so, therefore, using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Thank you.
First thing, I will say my second point. My second point is good for the area. Now students stay hotel during their--[inaudible]No, thank you. Now students stay hotel during their school trips. They can feel deeply about that area [inaudible] or the students' trip. On the other hand, if students could sleep at private homes, students could learn about the region deeper, such as culture, prayers, and so on, as a host speaker mentioned before. And deep learning will bring interested for the students about the area. If for students begin to like the area, it will bring a good effort for the area's environment. For example, if the student like that area, the student might work in that area in the future. In some regions, if you see yourself, other people [inaudible] or aging population, so coming students for the area is good for the society, right? And you might think that the [inaudible] is too big for the student to be [inaudible] for the student. But there is a home complex, and also kind of that, we can communicate and [inaudible], and if they will be interested in that area, they might build a home complex and kind of that. It will bring a good effort for the area because the aspect is commercial, that aspect and/or the lack of, they can solve the lack of hands. So it is good for the society.And I believe, [inaudible]. 
They said that junior high school students can learn the nature and kind of that from the agriculture and so on. [inaudible] mentioned before, [inaudible] before the [inaudible]. [inaudible] is important because you can learn the [inaudible], then the agriculture and so on.Do you want?No, thank you. 
They said that junior high school students doesn't know about the [inaudible], so it is bad. But we can surely say that the school will do a lecture for them before their trip, so it is [inaudible] for them. And also we can say that private homes will be prepared for the students' staying. So we can [inaudible] dissertations, and yes?What be the second point?My second point is that the interest in-- good for the area. We can say that the center problem will surely solved. So that point is fix. Thank you.
Thank you, my name is [inaudible]. I'll explain the first point and the second point. The first one is manner trouble. Usually, students learn about manners before going to the school trip. So we have a lot of solutions, so the first point is not so important as our first point told about that. And the second point, part of sanitation. So sanitation is really serious problem. So in the first case, students will die and so on. So students with the host family is extra careful not to have trouble of sanitation. So the second point is [inaudible], and we can prevent that situation as our second speaker told about that. And yes. Next, please think about what is the school trip, what purpose of that school trip. So students do school trip in order to learn about the local history and so on. If students go on school trip, they can learn about that local more deeply. Yes. Going that local is important. If we take this plunge, students can learn about local history deeply. My first speaker told you that process. And our first point is connect our second point. Through our first point, students will be interested in the area, it being good effect to that area. Yes, so our point is important and for the students. So please think about what is that school trip. Okay. Thank you.
Hello, everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels should be banned. First, let me [inaudible] with our second point. They said good property area. However, I think it is out of the market because this industrial hotel shouldn't be good for customer because service. So we have to think about our service, customer first. So because it is [up to us?] way that you go, therefore, I just [inaudible] right here. 
Then, I will summarize the data, but the most important point is there are many troubles with the hotel. On this point, the argument is we cannot allow old things and [inaudible]. This argument is a failure because now there are many problems between that [inaudible]. There is nothing we can learn from trouble because-- no thank you. Today, trouble it's not good image for society because it might be going to suffer physical punishment. It is not good. It is reported today.Wait, [inaudible]. Why we can't prevent the trouble? Because I have lecture and so on, but we cannot prevent the trouble.So okay. It's because it's going to different, depending human dimensions. We vary, by past energy, by culture. We can vary by emotional state, moment to moment. So we can say definitely about this topic. And, however, more importantly [inaudible] influential because the younger people have not developed intense judgement. So I think our current way of thinking is not working [inaudible], or it's making a trouble. We need a new source of inspiration. We have to question about this topic. Therefore, we believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Thank you.


Hello, everyone.And today's topic is using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. And we strongly believe that we should use private-- we strongly believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. If possible, let me define the motion. I define the motion as follows: school will be defined as elementary, junior high, and high school. We have two points. The first point is pollution. The second point is causing troubles to the residents. The first point is pollution. 
So I will explain about this point, pollution. So today in Japan, using private homes as hotel is becoming a big problem. This is because the number of foreigners who use private homes as hotel is increasing. And actually, in present situation, they are causing some problems with-- one of them is pollution. Because they throw away trash and litter everywhere. Because the environment in the area gets worse, the residents who live there are getting troubles. And thinking about, oh, having trash--[inaudible] permission.Yes, please.I think that those pollution is not caused by the private house. So what do you think of students staying at private house?We strongly believe that foreigners also cause trash, because they eat food in the private house, and a student also do it as well, we think. And if we allow students on the school trips using private homes as hotels, then pollution problem-- we strongly believe that gets bigger. Because please think about-- adults cannot throw away trash and litter properly. Do you think children who are in elementary, junior high school, and high school students can also throw away litter in a properly way? Well, we don't think that they can throw away litter properly, because adults can't even-- if adults can't do it properly-- for example, if there were students who are on school trips, and they get so much excited because they're on school trips, and I think they are not really thinking about manners. I think they throw away litter in an inappropriate way, such as they put plastic trash into-- they're not thinking about whether it is plastic trash or not. So in conclusion, we strongly believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Thank you.
What is school trip? School trip is for students to learn about many things. They go to other places and learn under the different environment from their daily lives. And to make their school trip more meaningful, we strongly oppose this motion. First, let me rebut the government's first point. They said about the pollution. But however, staying at private houses is not related to the pollutions. And even if they stay at hotels, not educated students will pollute and throw away trash. And we think that their argument is not on motion, and it is nonsense. And also, it is school's duty to educate students not to throw away trash, so their argument doesn't stand. 
So next, let me explain our points. We have two points. The first point is merit of using private homes for students. For students. And also, a second point is it will be an opportunity to promote the area. I will explain the first point, merit for students. Let's think about what is the uniqueness of using private homes, not hotels? Let's compare the hotels and private homes. Hotels are in all over Japan, so it is not different from local places. So by staying at hotels, we can't experience their local culture and so on.So next, let me explain the merit of students. We have three points. The first is, they can learn about culture. By staying at local house, they can learn many things. For example, the food, what they eat, and a dialect, or also what they usually do. And we can't know deeply without visiting their homes. And also, they can learn about their culture or a tradition by staying and talking with their local people. And second is to communicate with new people. We believe that students are able to gain many things because they are very flexible, so they need to know many new things. And just sightseeing is less opportunity to talk with local people. By staying at private house, they will get more opportunity, and their communication ability will increase. And the third is, they will become independent. By staying at local house, there will be no watch from the teachers, so the students try to be more independent. So those three points. It is very good for students, and it can be a meaningful school trip. And so, therefore, we strongly oppose this motion. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. First, let me rebut [inaudible] first point. They said that there is no link between using private homes and hotels or-- to problems, but it is not true. For tourists, because of disposal systems, pollution problem is not occurring. And also, private homes are really close to the resident area, and pollution will be tossed in places where people live. So there is very close relationships--[inaudible] permission.--close relationships between using private homes and resident area. No, this is the reconstruction of our first point. 
Next, let me explain our second point, causing trouble to the residents. I'm sorry, can I rebut to the opposition's first one? Students can learn many things, even if they stay at a hotel. We could make a alternative setting for students to learn about culture. They can learn to be responsible of themselves even at hotels. 
Now let me explain our second point, causing trouble to the residents. In present situation in Japan, the number of people who come to Japan is increasing rapidly, so lack of hotels is serious problem. And this is why the private homes appears recently, in order to support the place where they can stay. However, there are very big problems. People who stay at a private homes have a very loud voice. I heard on the news that not only foreign people, but also Japanese too, also, they dance on the noisy music and watch videos with the noisy music. It means that the people who stay at private homes cause a problem of noise. [inaudible] students using private homes. They also make a big noise, because they are on the school trip, and they are very excited and unusual. Then they must talk with their friends and have fun. Then, please think about what will happen--[inaudible] permission.No, thank you. Please think about what it does contribute. The inhabitant who live in this area are suffering from the noise, and they cannot ignore it. And maybe they will go another place. For example, Kyoto is a city with a long history. If we have so many private homes used as hotels, there will be so many people making noises and walking around. This will not only affect the residents living, but also the looks and image of Kyoto. It is very serious problem. So we strongly believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Thank you.
We strongly oppose this motion. So first, let me rebut government first point. They said that there problem of pollution. But however, it's doubtful because it's not only a problem that students who stayed at private homes for school trip has it. We believe that young people with no watching can cause much more pollution than student with teacher. And education is school's duty, so their argument doesn't stand. 
So now, let me move on to rebutting their second point. They said having trouble. But however, we don't say that we ban using hotel. We don't say that we ban using hotel. Teacher can choose private home or hotel. And teacher knows if their students have moral to decide they can act accurately. So teacher can choose it, so their argument doesn't stand. 
So now, let me reconstruct our first point. They said that they can learn culture even at hotel. But however, using private homes, we can live in local homes, so it's more close communication is definitely occurred. So that can be related to the real education to learn the cultures and customs. So it improve the quality of school trip. And at hotels, friends tend to stick to each other because they are in same room, then just talking about [inaudible]. So that is bad thing, because they study for school trip. So at private homes, they are in the small group, and then the private home's owner can talk at night, or something like that. So there will be more communication. So at private homes, we definitely say that we can learn more culture than hotel.
So now, let me move on to our second point. Our second point is, it will be an opportunity to promote the area. The owner of private homes can promote their area to students, and the students can live in local homes. This is private homes' uniqueness. Hotels doesn't have-- a student can live in the local homes. It means young people have experiences to live in those places. So this is really precious opportunity for them because even if there's no school trip, they wouldn't have the opportunity to live in those places. So they may think they will live those place when they will be adult, or they will visit there when they will be adult. So in Japan now, elderly people is increasing, and this is a big problem in Japan. Elderly people is increasing, and the population is now occurring, so it's really big problem for Japanese society. And so they need young people. So school trip will be really, really precious opportunity to promote the area. So if the population is solved, Japanese economy will be more and more promoted, and it will be-- that makes Japanese economy more better for all Japanese society. Therefore, we strongly oppose this motion. Thank you.
[inaudible] students staying at private home have many trouble. However, without [inaudible] teach students not to do bad thing. Even if we take this motion [inaudible]. If teacher thinks student make problem, teacher choose hotel. So teacher [inaudible]. If we take this motion, that deprive student of the opportunity [inaudible]. Also, that deprive local people of opportunity to introduce their culture. Though there are many good student, it is so bad effect for student, local people, teacher. So it is bad for everyone. Therefore, we strongly support this motion. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. First, we define-- I'm sorry, I made a mistake. We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. And first, let me rebut to the second point of the opposition. They said that using private homes as hotels will be able to promote areas in that region. However, we believe that that's not true. Because if you want to promote the area, then you can take the students to other places that you want to promote without even just letting them stay in a house. They won't learn anything.[inaudible] permission.No, thank you. So we think, isn't it better that the people take them around the town or the region to learn more about what's happening in that town? That way, they will promote more people, the young generation. 
Now, let me summarize today's debate. Their point is that school trips are for the students to learn new things that they cannot learn at school. On that point, our idea is that letting the students stay in local houses as hotels will cause more problems than benefits for the students. This is because, as we said in our first point, that there are pollutions among adults, which means that students cannot-- if adults can't maintain the cleanliness of the region, then how can students do that? And if it's the teachers responsibility for the students, who says that it would be the responsibility? The teacher cannot handle everything, what the students do. And also, we said causing trouble to the residents. And if we are going to say that the learning for the students are more beneficial than causing trouble to the residents, I think that is a big problem, because the residents are living there. Students have alternative ways to learn that we cannot learn at school. That is why we believe that using private homes as hotels for school should be banned. Thank you.
Hello.Today's topic is using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. We defined the school trips be in the country and outside the country. And also, that there are more than 100 people. We have two points. The first point is that the content of the stay will be different depending on where you stay. The second point is that there is a risk to having trouble with neighbors with having more people. 
I will explain the first point, which is that the content of the stay will be different depending on which home you stay in. We believe that because we will stay in different kinds of people's houses, the content will differ. Let me explain what I mean by this. In this world, there are rich and not so rich people. I doubt that the school will make the students stay at a very poor family's house, but I don't think the school-- but I don't think that they would mind as long as they take care of the children and feed them. It was different for me when I was in middle school. I went to Okinawa and stayed at a village mayor's home, which was very, very big. As for many of my other classmates, they stayed at - how do I say it? - ordinary people's houses that weren't as big. Also, the village mayor's son owned a surf shop where you can go to different kinds of rides such as banana boats or dragon boats or ski jets, etc. and I did all of those things, and might I say, for free. My other friends ended up just picking seashells or just fishing. And let me ask a question. Which do you think is more fun? I think that you guys would think that my trip was better than my other classmates. Therefore, I think that the content of the stay will be different depending on which home you stay in. Thank you [applause].
Hello, everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Let me rebut what the government team said. They said that contents will be different and this is not good thing. But, however, we think it's not a good thing because differences will be benefit, I think. People prefer different activities. Some people like outdoor activities. But on the other hand, some people like visiting museums or cooking with local people. So--[Unappreciate?].Sorry. So I think differences will be benefits. So therefore, different contents will be good, I think. 
Next, let me explain our points. We have three points. The first point is friendship with the host family. The second point is locals. I will explain the first point, friendship with the host family. We believe that staying at a private home helps you to build a new relationship with local people because we live together in the same house. In addition, you can keep in touch with people in the house you stay. For example, I stayed at a home in Iwate prefecture with my family 10 years ago. And during our stay, the host family welcomed us very much and treated us like a real family. It was a very heartwarming experience for me. We still send letters each other and even 10 years has passed since we stayed there. On the other hand, if you stayed at a hotel, you can't experience such a relationship because it's a big business and such case will not happen. So I think staying at private house provide more chances to build new relationship. So I think it is good thing. [inaudible][inaudible] more times than [inaudible]. [foreign] I guess [inaudible] experience.Oh. I'm-- [inaudible]. Sorry. Therefore, we believe that using private houses as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Thank you [applause].
Thank you. Hello, everyone.Well, we believe that using private homes as hotels for schools should be banned. And first, let me reconstruct our first point. We said that the content might differ. So we don't think that to use private homes is not good. It's not good. And on that point, they said that the differences might be very good. You can experience so many different things. But, yes, we do think that the difference is a very good thing, but we can't choose which activities we do for the trips. For example, if I really like to-- if I really like to visit and fishing, but there's no guarantee that I will be able to go to the home and that the host family says that we can go fishing. So that I think that their rebut is pointless. And second--POI.No, thank you. 
Second point, so I would like to rebut their first point. They said that it is very important to make friendship with the host families. However, yes, you were very lucky. As I said, that if the contents was not so fun, that the students think the conflicts will may happen. So it is not good. Okay. 
So then, lastly, let me explain our second point. Staying private homes will sometimes be very dangerous for-- [crosstalk] [foreign]. Okay. Sorry. There is a risk to have trouble with neighbors. Okay. If many students stay at small, private homes, I think that the private homes, it's usually smaller than big hotels. Sometimes there will  be some trouble or accident with neighbors. For example, when I was the second grade junior high school student, we visited [Mie?] and we also used private homes. But in the night, the neighbors, who were very angry, complained that we were too noisy. So I think that this is just only one example that I experienced with trouble with neighborhood, but we believe that using private homes as hotel for schools should be banned.
Okay. So first, I'm going to attack your first opinion. [inaudible] said that the fun depends on where you stay. You said that if you can-- or if you don't use the private house, you have more possibility to enjoy your school trip. But we don't know what will happen, what will going on. So your first opinion is not relevant. 
And next, your second point is [inaudible] it is dangerous to use private house. There are some risks. You gave an example of that the host family was angry because you were too noisy, but the same case will happen in the hotel. Because let's think about the case of a hotel, if you were talking all night, if you were noisy, the hotel staff will be angry. And they will come your room and said, "You are too noisy." They will be angry. So your second point is not relevant. 
Next, I'm going to reconstruct our first reasons. Sorry. You said that we can choose that-- or if we use a private home, we can choose what we want to do. But the purpose of the school trip is to experience the [inaudible], which is very valuable. And we can't experience in our normal life. So our first point is good. 
And next, I'm going to talk about our second point. So our second point is low cost. Using private homes are more cheaper than using hotels. Sorry. Sorry. Before my speech, I'm going to attack your second reason again. And also, we can judge the private house, which is the house is good or bad. The school should check before the school trip's began. And, sorry, let me explain our second point. Using private homes is more cheaper than using hotels. And first, our purpose of the school trip is to experience the valuable things, not experience a luxury. It is the most important to experience valuable things. And next, we can use a difference for experiencing valuable events. And it doesn't cost a student a lot of money so the school can give chances to go school trips for all the students. So that's all.
Hello, everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. Let me summarize today's debate. The most important thing is that using private hotels will make the quality of the school trip much better. On this point, their idea is that, first, the content differs between houses and that there's risk to stay in a private home. However, our argument is superior. First, the main purpose of school trips is not to spend luxurious time, but to experience new things at different places. Hotels will not provide any extra opportunity for students, but private homes will provide an extra opportunity. Our first point was that there will be a new friendship with a host family. This will make the trip a better quality because it will let the students create a new friendship with a new family in a different place. And this will expand their personal and private society. And it will continue for the rest of their lives. And it will make their trip much more quality. This also enhances the quality of the trip-- oh, no. Sorry. Our second point was that private homes will support lower cost. This also enhances the quality of the trip because everyone should go to a trip. And they should be provided equal chances to go to the trip for all the students in the school. And their point was that there is a risk. And there are houses and the content differ between each houses. But we can think that the school can first judge which houses the students stay so that the school can support equal chances for all the students. So we don't think there is-- we don't have any concerns for that point. Therefore, we think that using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. Thank you [applause].
Okay. Hello. We believe that using private home as a hotel for school trips should be banned. And, of course, when we wrote the second point, this is experience things in each team. Our prime minister said that the school check the families background. As long as they are able to feed, then it's okay. And each team [inaudible]. And there is a cheap hotel, where there is no evidence that private home is cheaper than hotels. 
And let me summarize today's debate. In this debate, our points are very good [inaudible] discrimination with each private homes. And [inaudible] risk to have trouble with neighbors. And the opposition team's primary two points [inaudible] for me and experiencing [inaudible]. And also, they argue the different will be benefits. Of course, you can choose activities. However, some activities is popular. So many people want to do that, so there is a limit-- but there is a limit to the number of people. So some of them need to do activity that they don't want.[inaudible]Yes. And--POI.Sorry. And then they said that if it's noisy in the hotel, there is the same things happen. But hotels may have soundproofing effects and teachers are with them in the hotel. So teachers can stop them.POI.Oh, sorry. Then, let me explain why we should win this debate. We could explain, there is bad effects in the private homes. And our argument is superior to opposition's main point. Therefore, we strongly believe that we should win. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. I'm the prime minister of the government side. Our definition is-- our target is elementary students, and the second, private home means [inaudible] house, and three, staying private home means children stay one home. And there are enough teachers and [inaudible] not of school. And our first reason is students will be put in dangerous situation. And the second reason is we can solve health program-- sorry, our first reason is students not will be put dangerous situations. So I changed. 
And now we have a problem. Using private homes as hotels, security is so bad. Usually, students stay hotel with some teacher. Also students stay together in same hotel. Also, in hotel, there are some security guard, and hotel staff.However, in private residence, private home, there are not these securities and staff and the teachers. So students, if we use private homes, students would--POI.Sorry, after my speech, please. And students put on dangerous situations, a process is [inaudible] adopted, this [topic?] is adopted, and the second [inaudible] will happen. For example, [inaudible] and the residents-- no, without this [public?] is adopted, some problem will be happen. Because, for example, sexual harassment by resident, or there are possibility of criminals come in the house, for example, this. However, if we introduce this [inaudible]-- sorry. However, if there are dangerous situations happen, teacher cannot go the house [inaudible]. So they cannot save their students. However, if they just [be strong?] these dangerous situations is not happen, will not happen. So it is so important because safety of children is most important point.Okay. [inaudible]? Please. Sorry.So you said that at private homes then there is no security, and there are no teachers. However, in home stays, home staying, students stay at a private home. So why do you think that on school trips this should be banned?Okay. If students stay private homes, there are some dangers because sexual harassment by residents, or some criminals come in home.But they can't always [inaudible].But we should stay in hotels because there are some security staff, or security guard, and we can stay with teacher. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. [inaudible]. Today we have two arguments. First argument is can go through valuable experience. Second argument which is going to explained by my partner is trouble for [inaudible]. Before my argument, let me repeat what the previous speaker has said. The previous speaker has said that if we stay in private homes, there are many dangerous things such as sexual harassment or enter criminals. However, this is not true because so the case of home stays, the students stay private homes and it is true case student [inaudible] sexual harassment or enter criminals. So it is [so the case?] so argument does not stand.
Let me move on to our argument. Our first argument is can go through valuable experience. So let me explain. So now--POI.No, thank you. So private students staying private homes is students can [inaudible] experience [inaudible] in private homes because the relationship between host and student is so close, and the host knows--POI.No, thank you. So many [noise about there?] so students can so many valuable experience such as cooking with local foods, or local recipe. And [try some?] games and songs. Through these experience, students and hosts can make more friend or [inaudible] strong relationships. So why this point is important. So first, let us go to [inaudible] we think school trip is a chance to learn a bit of a place which they go. So to stay at private homes has so big [inaudible] for students because they can know their situation, and so it is a big plus of school trips. So to stay at private home it's so good for students for all the reasons we [inaudible]. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. I'm a member of the government side. Let me attack [inaudible]. You said children can know about the local things. However, in the hotel they can eat local things. And you said just cooking example; however, [inaudible] cook in the private house, they are cooking. They are [inaudible] sanitation, so they are possibly the [inaudible]. So it's so they are [inaudible]. 
And let me [inaudible]. You said home stay example, however, have you ever [heard?] elementary school students go to home stay? It's so [messy?]. And now home stay, junior high school student, and the high school student, go to home stay then they can call their parents, and they can call the police. We can [inaudible]. However, elementary students can't either, because they don't have a lot of noise. Then--POI.Then, police-- then a private house has people think they can't do anything to call her mom. And there aren't teacher in a private house because there are many students and there are many private house. Then it has [inaudible] of teacher helps immediately to, yeah. 
And let me explain our reasons, too. [inaudible] the point is that we can solve the children's health problems. We have a problem now, in the private homes, students easier to become health problem, and the students can't cure by [inaudible]. We can solve this problem by addressing the [inaudible]. Let me explain why. First, the public is [inaudible]-- sorry, students [inaudible] sick because there aren't [inaudible] sanitation because in the hotel, in the school there are many [inaudible] condition. However, as you said, in private homes elementary school students come with cooking, then they are possibility of becoming sick. However, there aren't [inaudible] enough. [inaudible] so they are sick immediately. Then their condition will be bad. So it is [inaudible] for them. However, if we were willing to [inaudible] will disappear, then they can stay hotels then [inaudible] has sanitation [inaudible] of becoming her problem. Then [inaudible]. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. I am the second speaker of the opposition side. And now I'd like to make a rebuttal to what the previous speaker said. So the previous speaker said that we can always cook-- we can get local food in hotels, and something like that. However, in a private home, there is an extremely close relationship between the host and the student. Therefore, because the host and the student are so close, then you can talk about all kinds of things with the local people.POI.No, thank you. And this is an extremely rare thing that we can only experience in private homes. Because at hotels then you can only get food and other things, but you don't actually get a chance to talk to the--POI.--normal local people. Yes?For example, what just private home can do what you-- what is [nuisance?]?For example, at hotels then there are only the students and the teachers. However, in a private home there is a local person who knows about the culture of the city you're staying in. Therefore, you can learn about all kinds of knowledge from the local person that you simply cannot get at hotels. 
And furthermore, they said that home stays are a very rare case. However, there are a lot of students who go on-- elementary school students who go on home stays, so this point does not stand either. 
And furthermore, they said that nurses can't cure students if students stay at a private home. However,, there is a main program, right? You are only staying at the private hotel home at night, right? So all the students would go together on a trip with their teachers and the nurse. So the nurse can [see?] the students there in the main program. So this point does not stand.
So now I would like to explain the second point of the opposition side, less trouble for other tourists. So what are we supposed to worry about when we take students on a school trip? We have to think about where can our students experience a lot of things about culture? Where can the students learn about all kinds of things? So we explained this in our first point. And our second point is, would there be any trouble for other tourists? Normal tourists who, for example, let us think about [Kelso?]. So you are taking your elementary school students on a trip to [Kelso?], and you are taking 200 or 300 students. If these students stay at a hotel where normal tourists would also stay, then because there are a lot of students, then normal tourists cannot get rooms, cannot reserve the rooms because there's so many students. However, by having these students stay at a private home because these students are staying at different places, which normal tourists cannot stay at, normal tourists can reserve rooms in hotels, and everybody, including the students, and the normal tourists can go to a certain tourist spot. So therefore, to summarize, we explained that there will be less trouble for other tourists, if we let students stay at private homes. Thank you.
So good afternoon, everyone. So let me summarize the motion. So first, I have one question. So if the student really be in a dangerous situation, or not, the government side said that there are many dangerous things, like sexual harassment and also [inaudible]. However, our side pointed out that it is not true because sexual harassment is very rare, and [inaudible] security is the same as the hotel. So their argument doesn't stand. So and let's think about the meaning of the school trip. School trip, what is school trip? School trip is [inaudible] places, culture, and learn about their culture. So in this meaning, they did not explain that. So in contrast, we keep saying, as the meaning of the school trip, and we can-- if we stay in private homes, we can experience a lot. For example, cooking the traditional food, or something. So if we do not take this motion, we can have a precious experience, and you know the school trips time is very limited, so it's very important that we can have precious experience. So therefore, our argument still stands. So for all this--POI.No, thank you. For all these reason we have won the round. Thank you.
[inaudible] opposition reason two. You said normal people can not reside because of students stay at hotel. But it is not true. How much are these problem for normal people cannot stay because of children staying there? It is unclear. And then also they are also living in hotels, so normal tourists can't stay, and also--POI.[inaudible] and you said we [can decrease trouble?], but what there are trouble in the hotel between normal people and students. It is unclear and also teachers see [inaudible] and students, so--POI.Sorry. 
So [inaudible] and the most important point is we have to protect children [inaudible]. Our first reason are elementary students safety and even [inaudible] to put on dangerous situations, teachers have to protect elementary students [inaudible]. So why teacher let children go to dangerous situations--POI.Teachers have to protect students. And also why they could [inaudible] people is very dangerous because we don't know how much our trouble are thinking, or [inaudible]. So they cannot cure children if they have illness, or if they [inaudible]. And also our second reason if students have a bad [experience?] that cannot. Oh, thank you.
Hello everyone. Today's topic is using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Would you find [inaudible] as follows. Students use private homes as hotels all days and schools make separate groups of few people and students in different homes. We have two points. The first point is the problem of safety. And the second point is the importance of group cooperation for students. 
And I'll explain the first point, the problem of safety. It is difficult to make sure that own homes and hotels are safe for children because too many homes aren't. Some may be dangerous for children. Here many people who's bad and some may hurt children. Teachers can't watch so parents and students worry about if the house is safe. And so school trips should be a thing that everyone can enjoy and parents wants children to enjoy the trips. So the place that children stay should be safe place. And some students have people who live in private homes too. Students excited to stay with friends and they make noise. It is very bad. And students excited so much and it is difficult to stop for themselves. And they cause problem for not only people who live in private but also neighborhoods because neighborhoods travel too. So it is not good for children and parents and teachers and people who live in the private home. So we believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Thank you.
Hello everyone. We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Let me debate what the government team said. They said it's doubtful about safety. However it is always true. Now people make community to welcome students in school trip in local areas. They will welcome them. So they make a list of homes to welcome students and they prepare for a long time. Using private home because good [inaudible]. Therefore your first point doesn't stand. 
Next let me explain our points. We have two points. The first point, Japanese culture. [inaudible] point it's developing local society. I will explain the first point, Japanese culture. We believe that using private homes as hotels lead to learning Japanese culture for students more. If students, especially who leaving urban areas, go to local areas in their school trips. It has it's traditional cultures such as [inaudible] and [inaudible] Okinawa. And they use private homes as hotel then they get lot of their culture there. Such opportunity may be [inaudible] for [inaudible] students especially in urban areas. So it's very good chance to feel Japanese local culture. They can feel Japanese good points there. So they will come to like the [inaudible]. Therefore using private homes as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Any questions? Actually I had a school trip when I was a junior high school student. I went Okinawa. I used the private homes as hotels there. I was very happy. I spent very happy time so I think using private homes is--You said that not all house is dangerous but how can teachers know that all house is safety?When I interviewed the community because the community-- this [inaudible] has-- I can know which houses before I went to Okinawa so I know it's very safe. Thank you.
Hello. Today's topic is using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. We agree. First let me recount what opposition said. They said we can learn Japanese culture from staying at a home as hotels but there are a lot of museums about Japanese culture [inaudible] and so we can learn those culture from this. And urban area so many cultures from local area [inaudible] urban area so we can learn effectively. More local culture in the urban area so it is not true. 
And second, let me reconstruct her first point. They said the home as a hotel is not always dangerous. But it is important focus. Right, it's the most important thing. So if the possibilities are small, the danger is bigger. It is so, so, so big problem [inaudible] the most important. And so we can say more safer the better.
Second let me explain our second point. The information-- the [inaudible] because all those homes are not big enough to stay students-- to host a student to stay. So students are obliged to stay separately. So some activities like group talking or class reading can't be held. So we can learn this. We can learn important things from this so we can-- so for example we have unique atmosphere in the school trip. For example some student say I love you in the school trip so if you can use this atmosphere effectively and we can unite students effectively. It's good for class and learning, really learning because if the class are united and students can easily ask other students questions so-- but if the students are separated they lost all the chance of this. So students can't get those benefits. It's so [inaudible] and we can say-- we can also say this [inaudible] because we can learn in [inaudible] of [inaudible] and the school trip is the only event that the students can learn the importance of unity [inaudible]. For the usual travel-- the private travel-- students can travel with friends who is close to them. So they can travel comfortably. But in the school trip there is some friend who is not close to the students. So we can learn how to help [inaudible] and how to talk to those students and this will be usable when they became adults. For example company trip with colleague who is not close to the employees very much. It is so usable. So it is so precious that all the students can take communication with students or in the hotel. That's all.
Hello everyone. We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. As for government's second point they said we can't enjoy private homes. However if we-- I think it's better to go other area. For example rural area. Therefore their second point doesn't stand. Go ahead.We said that the most important problem is students have to stay separately. Right? So the point is not about what you're talking for second point. Right.
Next let me reconstruct opposition's first point. They said there are museums-- other museums. So many cultures [inaudible] however I think we had a better see our own eyes [inaudible]. Therefore our first point is still stand. 
Then let me explain our second point. Developing [inaudible] society. We believe that it is good for local areas. For example students learn some attractions of local areas such as food, culture, festivals. Also it leads to side see culture. It gives people in these areas a lot of profit. Thanks to this a local area is revitalized. Also people in local areas can report their famous or popular things to them. Therefore using private homes as hotels for school trip shouldn't be banned. Thank you. [applause]
Hello everyone. We believe that using private homes for hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Let me summarize today's debate. The most important point is first local people and [inaudible] can get profit. On this point their idea is [inaudible] dangerous and [inaudible]. However our argument is [inaudible]. Local people can tell their culture. Second students can have experience so [inaudible] people [inaudible] can get. [inaudible]. Therefore using private homes as hotels for school trips shouldn't be banned. Thank you. [applause]
Hello everyone. We believe using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Let me rebut opposition's second point. They said local society will be good. However the point is supporting local [inaudible]. It is not related to homes as hotels. 
And second let me summarize today's debate. The most important point is if using private homes as hotels will make school trips better. On this morning the point is using private homes as hotels will make us learn Japanese culture-- Japanese local culture. It's good for local society. But our argument is better. That's because we believe that this school trips is more important to spend with classmates and teachers safely. If we use private homes students will be divided into a lot of homes so they can't spend the time with many students and teachers. Teachers can't see students [inaudible] so if students have any trouble with hosts or other students or health problem, teachers can't solve the problem. In school trip if you don't have to take [inaudible] when we are out of teacher's monitor our learn culture will [inaudible]. The most important thing students should learn or experience is [inaudible]. Student learn the importance of [inaudible] or pay more attention to other students and daily life and enjoy with students and teachers [inaudible] or experience of using private home can be experienced in private trip. It's different between school trip and private trip. We have only one school trip in our life so we should enjoy with our friends. We should spend our time with teachers. So therefore our [inaudible] is [inaudible] using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned. Thank you.

Hello everyone.Today's topic is using private home as hotel for school trip should be banned. Behind that while using private homes as hotels the owners they're not [inaudible]. We have two points. The first one is parents worry about their children. And second point is the economic decline of local hotels. 
I'm [inaudible] but I'll explain the first point, right? Parents worry about their children. The owner for leaving the home at which the student use as a hotel are not professional, so they can't take responsibility. For example, if the students are hurt they can't-- who will take the responsibility? Also, some people have allergies, so the people who are leaving their home make their food so that is hard for them. Also, if the children live in the home hotel, teachers can't enter it, so they can't watch the students.Point. Why is having no teacher in hotels or, I mean, private homes is a bad thing?First, teachers can't watch the students, so they can do bad things. For example, go out unto the night and so it's bad problem. Also, teachers can't voice down, so they can't tell the parents how students do in the trip, so it is bad thing. Therefore, using private home or hotel for field trip should be banned. Thank you.
Okay. Hello everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be banned-- should not be banned. Let me rebut what the [inaudible] said. They said that parents will worry about the children. However, since private homes are less guarded, teachers will pay more attention to the students so that they don't do any bad things than in hotels. In hotels, as long as the students are inside their rooms, the teachers don't have to pay close attention to these students, so their point is wrong. 
Now, next, let me explain now two points. The first point is we can experience more things deeply. And the second point is we can make a more flexible school trip. I will explain the first point. We can experience things deeply. We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trip should not be banned. If we stay in normal hotels in the past, we tend to play games in the hotel room and waste precious time for more experiences during the school trip. However, by using private homes as hotels we can experience the real life of the local people. For example, one local person showed us-- showed me and recommended to me some places to visit in the night and--[inaudible].No, thank you. And I was able to have experienced more things than staying in hotels. It is important for the students during the school trip that they have-- that they don't-- they use all of their time to learn what they can, learn whatever they can. Yes?[inaudible] that using private homes as hotels [inaudible] students have now [inaudible] by staying in these private homes. How [inaudible]?Oh. Okay. So during the time that-- during the time the students in normal hotels are in their rooms or the students in private homes can go to places that the owner recommends.[inaudible].No, thank you. So we should-- so using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned. Thank you.
Okay. Hello everyone.Okay. So let me start by rebutting what the opposition said. The first point is that they said that we can experience more things more deeply and experience local life while staying at-- than staying in hotels. However, how much time do you spend at the hotel anyway? You don't really spend much time in the hotel, so even if you--[inaudible]. I want to check one thing, but is there-- in the private homes are the owner of the homes are staying with the children?No. [inaudible].Okay.Okay. Sorry. Oh, yes. Yeah. So they said that you can spend more good time than staying in hotels, but you don't really spend that much time in hotels during school trip, so that is not a problem. And they also said that we can go to places that the owners recommended, but we define that-- what? We define that by using private homes as hotels, the owner of the hotels will not be in there, so their opinion is wrong. 
Next, let me reconstruct what we said our point about parents being worried about us because the hotel is not kept by professionals. They said that teachers will pay more attention to the students because we are not staying in [inaudible] professional. However, in the school there's more than 100 students and there's barely more than 10 teachers. How can a teacher check on every student in every hotel? That is why I think that their opinion is not [inaudible].[inaudible].Sure.Why can't the student [inaudible] in the private hotel are different because they're different?Okay. Well, they're not kept by professionals, there are no staff, and the students are staying by themselves. I think that that makes it really different and really more not safe. I think that people will think about that. 
Please let us explain our setting point. The decline of local hotels and inns. School trips are often done in local places far from the city. School trips give a chance to local places like [inaudible], Nagano, Gifu, Gumma in winter, or maybe, Kochi and Wakayama in the summer. Last, as you say most school has hundreds of children and more of the teachers stay at hotels, local hotels, they will have a big economic effect. But if the private homes starting using their homes as inns, the hotels economic power will decline leading to the decline of the local society, which is--[inaudible]. Why do you think if you [inaudible] the economic benefit for the whole society will decrease?Well, because, of course, local hotels-- the local hotels does give a good impression on their local society and local environment, so if people stop-- people, especially students stop staying at local hotels, I think that the local environment will decrease too. But that's their point, so which is why we think that using private homes as hotels for school trips should be abolished. Thank you.
Okay. That's a nice speech. Okay. Hello everyone.We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trip should not be banned. First, let me rebut to the [inaudible] first point. This is a-- since now we all have a lot of-- since many schools have a lot of students and there's no [inaudible] it will be very dangerous because there will be no time-- no one to look after him. However, in each home usually at least 8 or 10 people can stay. Also--[inaudible].No, thank you. Usually the home should be close together so the teacher should just run outside, check each house to see if there are anyone else, because no teacher with their effort-- still, even we could use private homes, no teacher let students stay for 10 kilometers away, so it's not a big burden. And the hotels are actually more dangerous because there's a possibility a person will sneak in the hotel, open the lock, and go in the room.[inaudible].Okay.What's the possibility of hotels being break in? And--Well, that possibility is that more than the possibility that private homes can be break in, so it doesn't matter. 
So let me rebut to the [inaudible] second point. Business and local hotels will get depression and it will not be good for the local economy. However, after this, even when local private hotels and homes are not banned, the students are still in the same region so it'll-- in comparison it gives money to the region. So this point doesn't change. So the [inaudible] first, second point has not being important. 
Now then we can try our first point. We think that in normal hotels this is the-- normally there's no owner and local hotels are better than private homes. However, even if the owner isn't staying in the home, he or she can just pick a brochure to see how big the region is or what places to look or so on. Also, if you're in a private home within a hotel you'll just be playing, but if you're in the nature you'll be able to look at the sky, you'll watch night birds or so on. So it's way more better than the local hotel so we can experience more deeply which is also connected with nature and culture. 
Now, let me explain the second point. We'll be able to make a more flexible school trips. Now, since hotels are very limited you can go to a far place that is quite far from the hotel. However, after introducing this ban, since we can stay in private homes, you'll be able to go to places that are in the rural areas more easy. For example, we can play in the, for example, forest or fields until the evening, then go to private homes in the region and then go to visit the place in the morning. So we are going to be able to experience the rural areas such as Nagano and even more places for a longer time. It is very important for everyone to know about the rural areas and using private homes is the best way to solve this. Therefore, using private homes as hotels for school trips should not be banned because it'll deprive the possibility for students to experience the nature and culture of the rural areas. Thank you.
Hello. I'm [inaudible]. We believe that using private homes as hotels should not be banned. Let me summarize [inaudible]. The most important point is how can we make this project more meaningful. On this point their idea is by using hotels the students will be more safer. However, these teachers will absolutely think about a solution. So for example, by calling each house and check the safe of the-- confirm the safe-- whether the student is there or not, and they stay near to the private home. So this problem can easily be solved. And our argument is superior it is because if we use private homes you can learn deeply about the area but not just learn its surface, for example, their lifestyle and culture because the owners can tell us about the place. And the local people know about their local area the most and that we can learn about their place, their area, the whole time including the night. Also, by using private homes we can save money and the choice of the place which we stay at night will increase, so we can use money on other things. And the variation of the students art can increase, therefore, students can use their whole time to learn the place and meet-- and the more [inaudible] and the-- so the school trip will be more meaningful by using the private homes. Therefore, we believe that using private homes as hotels for school trip should not be banned. Thank you.
We believe that using private homes as hotels for school trip should be banned. First, let me rebut opposition second point. They said students can experience local life. However, I think that Japan when students stays at the hotel is very limited.[inaudible].I'm sorry. I say that they say student can [inaudible] of private homes. However, I think most of those times student will sleep, so I think the student can't [inaudible] local life and nature at the private homes. Also, [inaudible] so most people point is just [inaudible]. On this point their idea is a student can [inaudible].[inaudible].
Sorry. However, our argument is superior because [inaudible] point is student's parents. They must be uneasy because [inaudible]. So if students stay on private homes their [inaudible] increase because private home is not necessary [inaudible].[inaudible].Sorry. The owner of private, however, is [inaudible] in running compared with professional manager. So for purpose of-- except for school trips it might be good. However, I think for school trips it isn't good. Then as our second point the economic decline of Japanese style hotel of local places by visiting private-- by students [inaudible] at local places, school--[inaudible].Sorry. So for the private firms a school trip is a very big challenge through money, so therefore, using private home as hotel for school trips should be banned. Thank you.
