Hello, everyone. I'm not [inaudible] but I will do the best. So which [side of the?] today's debate. Today's topic is, people should have a microchip implant in their own body. [We define the motion at homes?]. Microchip is small chip which is not hard to put in. And the government will pay money for microchips to put in. So we got two point. The first point is [unnecessary procedure?] will decrease. And the second point, advance of the humanity. 
I will explain the first point. And second will explain [late, I think?].Imagine it. For example, if you want to travel, it has a lot of the [procedure?] to take many [inaudible] and unnecessary situation. Like this, you will go the [inaudible] to the Japan. You will show the baggage and the [garment?] check, check there's not something strange. And you will show the passport and [they'll also put in the?] [inaudible]. It's unnecessary situation because we can more short [procedure?]. It's unnecessary, don't you think so?And imagine [the?] situation, imagine if you are suffering because you had a damage for earthquake, you should call a ambulance. But a ambulance doctor can't identify who you are, [or whoever?], if you can't say anything and you can't do this anymore. But however, if you take this motion, you show the chip and the doctor can identify of who you are.Why do we have to [charge this point?]? Because some people are suffering right now and this is a reason to take in. And I will tell you more points PowerPoint. Why do we have to choose this one? Because some people suffering right now. It is caused by unnecessary situation. For example, the government officer, they're willing to [endure?] a lot of unnecessary job. But they will do the hard work but they can't receive the money, more enough money. This is serious and we should show discretion to take this motion. Thank you. 
Hello, everyone. We believe that people should not have a microchip implant in their own bodies. Let me rebut what the [government team?] say. They say it's maybe unnecessary situation will [defeat?]. However, it is not so important because it is just unnecessary and not have to remove such situation. It is no serious reason and it has risks. For example, become sick and - I'll explain later - increase terrible crimes. And so their first point is very weak. 
And next, let me explain our point. We have two points. The first point is, increase terrible crimes. Increase terrible crimes. And the second is, [inaudible]. [inaudible]. I'll explain the first point, increase terrible crimes.In present situation, pickpockets, they sometimes happen. Robber robs key, wallet, and so on, and passport. When they robs such as things, a robber robs a bags or a keychain and such things in present situation. But it means - certainly, there are pickpockets happen - however, it isn't a serious crime because just only robbing, not kill person. After the [plant?], a pickpocket will be more and more and more serious because robber have to kill a person to rob key or a wallet or a such things. [Please imagine?], in present situation, pickpockets just rob their bag and just rob their things. However, after implant, robber have to kill the person to rob things because chips is implant our bodies. If chip's implant into our wrists, a robber have to kill the people, kill the person and cut their wrists. It is very serious. And so, two, robbing such things they have to-- so robbing a key or such a things they have to robbing part of bodies because the chips, they'll be implanted. So pickpockets will be more and more and more serious because it kills a person. It robs a life. [Implants?] should be good for people, however, this plan will be bad for people because the crime will be serious. I beg to propose. Thank you. Oh, oh, oppose. [applause]
Hello, everyone. We believe that people should have a microchip implant in their own bodies. Okay. So let me rebut opposition's first point. They said that they will increase of terrible crimes. For example, pickpockets, they're going to kill people and take money from the chip. However, this is very unlikely to happen because they are killing people. They're killing people. That means you arrested and going to jail. Maybe you are going to spend most of [your?] life in the jail. And it's really big punishment for killing people. And so in criminal situation, there is a system of, if you are maybe poor and you don't have money, then you're getting [half?] money from the government. Very small amount of money but you can have your life by that. And there is no need like pickpocket to take monies and to kill people. This is really serious problem if they [won't?] do these things in [criminal?] situation. And this very unlikely to happen.
Okay. Next. Let me reconstruct [government's?] first point. They say there is no serious reason for doing these motion. However, our first speaker gave example of, for example, traveling or maybe the example of a disaster. But it is also using normal life for example, like using as a prepaid card or prepaid things. Or for example, [know?] you enter the security by a chip. There's many usage for these microchips. We can do a lot of things. And this very good point is there is really lots of time using these [inaudible] things. For example--But wait.Yes?Why is it bad for--? Why is it bad? A smartphone or a smartwatch, maybe, we can do such things [also?] by a smartwatch or a smartphone. Why [crosstalk]--?So the uniqueness of these microchips is that you can put it - any body, every time - in your hand. Okay. So if you use [inaudible] or other wallets that you have to put together, [inaudible] wallet, it is really lots of time. Maybe 10 minutes or 20 minutes, whole days. And even you can do other games, or [maybe writing novels?], or you can do whatever you want. And it is more important for a human. Yeah?
Hi. Let me explain about our second point, is about advancement of the humanities. Okay. It's time for a long-term perspective. It's not just this decision will change our humanity's future for whatever. Because after we conduct this policies, there will be so much benefits for us. Something like trans-humanism or something like that. We can compensate ourselves with that kinds of [inaudible]-- I'm sorry, machines or [IC?] chips. And we can unlock the limit of the human bodies. And they say that they can use smartphone, or something like that, instead of implanting some machines into our bodies but it's not that good or it's not that huge change. We have to change ourselves to survive this world. We have to evolve to next generation. So that's why, I think, we have to introduce these kinds of implants to our bodies and then, [boom?], it gave us a greater abilities to our bodies. It means that the society's efficiencies will be highly increased and that means that the human race happiness will be increased and that's very good for our society. Thank you very much. [applause]
Hi, everyone. Now, I'll reconstruct our first point. As they said, if criminal happened crime, a criminal receive big penalty. However, it's not so important because now criminal [inaudible] killing. But if we [end up?] [inaudible], criminal have to [inaudible] for getting our information. [Please imagine], if such a crime happen, what [use is an appeal?]? Of course, they [appeal?] the terror, worry, and so on. This motion may cause very serious crime. And even if it's small case, as I, and our first speaker, clearly told you, it's very, very terrible crime. It will makes this worry and terror. Government must not [ridicule the?] danger. [inaudible]-- no, thank you. But this motion have to lead so. So their rebut point is very big.
And I will explain our second point. Our second point is that there are alternative ways. As our first speaker told you, there are risks that they [killed with terrible?] [inaudible]. Or as they told us, purpose of this crime is [helping?] suffering people in present situation. But to do so, why do they have to implant a microchip in their body? This way is too hard for people, as our first speaker told you. So I will show alternative way. For example, using smartphone or a computer. This is very [inaudible] way. And though, [perfect?] in present situation, right, government can achieve the purpose without this plan. For such things, people who are suffering, the government can use [DPS?] or [each a?] smartphone or a computer. Government can use alternative way. As first speaker told you, after the [plant?], terrible crime will increase. So people who don't have to be killed in present situation, will be killed after the [plant?]. As they say, there are alternative ways, like prepaid account or microchip case. So they don't have to implant that.
And [inaudible] their second point, their second point is advance of the humanity. But it's not so important. Why do you think this motion is only in [inaudible] otherwise of the humanity? As I pointed out to you, there are alternative way, for example, using smartphone and so on. It's advance of humanity too. It's enough to solve problem for us. Now, we are satisfied with present situation and its [police safety, isn't it?]? [inaudible]. So, oh. We don't have to endure this plan. So their second point is very weak. So to protect [inaudible] is most of important in Japan, the world. So we don't have to [ridicule?] danger, [inaudible] [student?] danger. So we have to protect the [students?] and we don't have to introduce this plan. Thank you. [applause]
Hello, everyone. Today's topic is people should have a microchip implant in their own bodies. We are opposition side. And so I will summarize today's debate in the side of opposition side. Okay. I'll show you our team stance again. Our team stance is that they are alternative ways. So there are no uniqueness to this plan. Okay? Okay. I'll summarize today's debate. And the most important point is, which is good for all people? On this point, they are talking about useful, daily life. But we talked about lives. Which is more important? Useful life or lives? Of course, lives. We can't say that useful, daily life is more important than lives. As our first speaker told you, after the [plant?], there are risks to happen. The terrible crimes, it is certainly happen. Our first and the second speaker told you, there are people who don't have to be killed in present situation, will be killed after the [plant?] because they always have risks to rob their information, important information. And they have to have their risks that they don't have to have. And lastly, as the motion, governments pay money to implant chips. However, why government, which don't have enough money, have to pay money to these no-meaning plan? They don't have to, this plan. They have to pay money for other many ways. So they don't have to do it. And their arguments are not [standing?], they are no meaning. So I beg to oppose. Thank you. [applause]
So I'd like to start my speech. So first, I'd like to rebut to their second point. They said that there's-- sorry. There's a alternative way to solve this problem. But however, this is untrue. Because [ICTP?] [can?] identify a individual person, but smartphone [can't?]. And also if you want to use smartphone, then you can collaborate with smartphone and [ICTP?] to make it more better. So there, I even don't understand. 
And so I'd like to move on to summary. So in this debate, we stated that there's a lot of benefits if we take this motion such as reduction of needless time, or kind of doctor can't identify the individual person. But they stated that as a negative effect of this motion, that increases the crime rate. But however, the crime rate is really kind of low compared to the whole population. And also, they said the robber will kill people to rob something. But there is no specific reason that robber will kill people to rob something. Because there are huge penalty in Japan, the death penalty. So that will push down the crime rate, we think. And also, by introducing this [ICTP?] in our body, we will get a special, a great ability, and unlock limit of human ability. And this will make society efficient and this will benefit a lot. And also, yeah. So therefore, we are proud to take this motion. Thank you. [applause]
