first, why do people work? It is to live and increase their QOL and work should be reason for people's living. And to achieve that goal, we have to take this motion. So that's why today, we stand here and propose this motion. So first, I will define this motion as whole. This is both about the Japan and release the government from all this additional [inaudible] and government said one year [inaudible] for the companies because there are some companies have to make new system or others. So one year to promotion [inaudible] said. So we have two points. The first point is fulfill work-life balance and by promoting health. And the second point is taking up better condition for [inaudible]. 
So the first point is fulfill work-life balance by promoting health. So in current situation, there are many serious problems caused by long-time working. So the first example is the worst case, it's [inaudible]. So, for example, in [block?] companies, workers work so long time every day to do more overtime working [crosstalk]--[crosstalk]?Yes.The actual [inaudible] of the [foreign] is not a rest holiday, but overtime working.What does it mean?So the [inaudible] of [foreign] is not a rest holiday, but overtime working until late at night.A holiday of [inaudible] is also that so few relaxing time, so this number of day that people work in the week is also problem. So working day is also problem. So the [inaudible] case, worker work so long time every day, every week. And because of the pressure for the both, pressure for the company. And finally, they come to [inaudible] or suicide because of stress. For example, in a few years [inaudible] that [inaudible] companies [inaudible] committe suicide because of that. And the second case, even if they didn't die, many workers are suffering from so long time working because they may become diseased or injured from both of those. So from these, many workers are suffering from health and can't keep work-life balance and we cannot ignore those life. But if companies introduce the early working system, we can limit working time and workers can promote their freewill. For example, the father can go home early and make relationship between their child. And also, they can go to restaurant or eating out with their families. Another example is workers spend time to their hobby after they finish the work. For example, sports or, for example, go travel. And like this, people can promote QOL by seeking this motion while enjoying working and don't feel stress because of work. So workers can keep their health good because they don't have to work so long time and promote work-life balance. And it is important because, first of all, the purpose of working is to life and the [inaudible]. So if people suffer from working, it's against the purpose and we cannot ignore their life. [applause] So to make a new style of work-life balance, you have to take this motion. Thank you. [applause]
hello, everyone. This motion is only the nuisance for workers and current situation. We strongly oppose this motion. First, I will rebut what the government team said. They said, "We feel the work [inaudible]. But as I said in POI, a [inaudible] became serious problem because of the overtime working until late at night. So not the rest holiday. And there is a summer vacation in Japan so workers can enjoy their-- they can enjoy spending time with family in summer vacation. So their first one is nonsense. 
And today we have two points. The first point is burden on individuals. Second point is disadvantage for companies. I will explain the first point and my colleague will sum up our second point.First point, burden on the individual. In the status quo, employee work for eight hours per day, and there is a two days holidays. And all workers have to take rest three days per week after taking this motion. And lack of labor is serious in Japan, and companies need more laborers in current situation. And overtime working is very serious in current situation. And many people die because of the overtime working. For example, there's a young woman died because of the overtime working. And the amount of each workers will decrease by taking this motion. And in status quo, their income is decided by their amount of working. So if they take this motion, their income will decrease. So where is the negative effect by taking this motion? If employee have to work same things before taking this motion, they must work until late at night because they want to earn the money the same as before taking this motion and--[inaudible].No, thank you. As I said before, the overtime working-- the extra harm of the policy is not less early in the overtime working. So we should solve not the holiday times but also the work time in the per day. And in speaking of lack of labor, the problem will become much more serious because company force the employee to finish the work earlier in the day. The station might need some-- they might need some station this motion, but the people who have already worked with their limitation will have serious effect because they tend to stay late at night at the companies to achieve their quota.What is the impact by taking this motion? Employees' income will down, and the quality of living will also down. And especially young who want to raise their children don't have enough money to make the living. They will have difficulty to raise their children, and such people will tend to quit the child-raising. And workers will have the mental and physical disease after taking this motion, and overtime working will increase in companies. And more and more workers will suffer from this motion, and such workers will commit suicide, commit crime because of huge stress. So by taking this motion, many workers will have difficulty in the working. So we strongly oppose this motion. Thank you. [applause]
[silence] the government's duty is to help and secure all citizen's life, of course, including the workers' life because as my first speaker said-- as our dear first speaker said, in the present situation-- a lot of workers suffering from severe kind of overtime work in the present situation. That is why we have to secure-- the government have to secure, of course, workers' life in [inaudible]. That's why we propose this motion. First of all, let me quickly construct our first argument. So this [inaudible] [our tax pay?]. The [inaudible] is just losing [inaudible] overtime working however even if [inaudible]. Our parents work even the summer vacation or the winter vacation, right? So in this situation, the vacation time is not so-- so what we want to say here is about giving them constantly a holiday is important today, because it [inaudible] to securing the dear lives because, as my first speaker said, by taking the three holiday-- or maybe three holidays for each worker is effective to improve each worker's health situation, right? So in this situation-- as my first speaker said, in this present situation, a lot of workers are suffering from severe amount of work until too late long. 
So on this point-- in their first argument, it's mainly talked about [inaudible] a lot of worker are forced to work too late. They are forced to bring a lot of work to the home or the workplace. So from this point, let me quickly rebut what they said in two aspect. First, [inaudible] regulation income will be [big?]. However, we cannot understand what is a practical [inaudible] for each workers. Because each workers [inaudible] minimum wage or secured. Also, [inaudible] regulation, how those [inaudible] [lives will be oppressed?] because of the government's restriction. So what is the [inaudible]. And also, how can you say that the company will impose a lot of the tasks for a lot of workers because of two reasons. We don't think that the company will impose those works because two reasons. One, once those workers [inaudible], they will be [accused?] from those [inaudible], right? So in this situation, the probability is quite low. And also, once the information [inaudible], for example [inaudible], it is [inaudible] company's management. On this reason, we don't think what our dear [inaudible] [doesn't understand?]. So on this point, [inaudible] regulation, individual [inaudible] will not happen because of the company's duty or [some kind of thing?].
Next, I will talk about my second argument. Setting up better condition for the women. Our target is one, they already quit the job, and two, is they keep working in the present situation. So why do women quit the job? Because they do not have enough time to take care of their children or long work is too stressful for them in terms of physically and mentally, so they quit their job. And they're suffering from financially and mentally. So [not many?] [inaudible] want to work because of this [inaudible] then they have any choice to continue working all willingly, right? And of course, there is the [inaudible] who work willingly just because of the company's [inaudible] pressure [however didn't?] have enough time to take care of the children. However, once we take this path, what will happen? So working time is limited a comfortable condition will improve. So further, women have enough time to [take?]-- our first target, already quit women are the benefit--?[inaudible].Yes. Okay. [No, thank you]. Okay.Women has raised their children comfortably because they need constant time, not three days. So they can't [inaudible] by taking this measure.Oh, we didn't think so because even with three weeks, it is enough for the women to take care of their children because free time-- all day long is important for children because there are a lot of-- the children is infant [inaudible]. So on this situation, how can we say that it is not enough. We cannot understand. So willingly working for the women, they have enough time to take care of their children [inaudible]. So that's why we oppose-- so for [inaudible], we can secure those lives. That's why we propose this motion. [applause]
Today [inaudible] only nuisance for workers and company and everyone. So, first of all, I will leave out government first point then I'll move on to the second [inaudible] and then deconstruct my point then explain my point. So first of all, I will leave out government first point. Firstly, they said that we're going to spend much time for their amusement or child. However, it's not true because as first speaker said before the amount of work will decrease so they cannot get income so can't enjoy. They're faced with difficulty so the quality of life will decrease and so even the amount of work done decrease they have to work in a day and so the work in per day is increased. Overworking will increase so to make matters worse the worker will commit suicide or die so their argument is completely not true. 
So I move on to the second point. They say that women can lay down the children so it is good for society or something but it's not true because-- I'm sorry. The women [inaudible] constant time so even if they have free time, a free day it is not enough for them and so even if the time-- I'm sorry. And also the problem is not only time but also-- I'm sorry. The strengths of women and the [inaudible] they're taking this notion it's not enough for, now, raising up children so their argument is not true. And even if it is true but it's not good for children because the children is very-- we have to care about the children more so. It is like [absorbing?].[inaudible].No. Thank you. 
So I'll move on to my second point. Disadvantage of company. [inaudible] the company face a lack of labor and [inaudible] developing but if we take this notion the productivity of company will decline then competitiveness in the world will be declined. So what is the effect-- what is the process? We see that amount of the work will decrease, especially little and small companies. They are [inaudible] so [inaudible] that the company's profit will be declined [inaudible], and the competitiveness compared with a foreign country will be declined. What is the impact of this? If company's profit will be declined, there is going to be another [inaudible] so it is [inaudible]. So what is a [inaudible]? The [consumption?] will be declined. So [inaudible] worse, and to make matters worse, the company go bankrupt, and unemployment will be increased. The government has to pay the social security cost so [inaudible] still have to pay much money so the [inaudible] will increase. So our whole society will be declined and [inaudilbe]. So as in before, the world competitiveness will be decreased so if company's profit will be declined, the such vicious cycle will be continued so the [inaudible] oppose this motion. Thank you. [applause]
Okay. [inaudible] my speech. [inaudible] most important one is which is better for workers, companies, and economy? Okay. If we take this motion-- okay, I will explain about workers. If we take this motion, it means two cases. One is that the amount of the work for workers will decrease and income will decrease, and second is that the amount of the work for workers will not change. Okay. Okay, if the first case, workers income will decrease. So [inaudible] I will [inaudible] motion mothers or--[foreign]Thank you. Mothers and workers can do extra activities [inaudible]. That is the benefit of this motion, but it is not true because if their income will decrease, they cannot pay money for those education or other activities. So, therefore, it is [inaudible]. And in second case, the amount of the work for workers will not change. [inaudible] talk about overtime working and [inaudible], and if the second case, the amount of work for workers [inaudible]--[inaudible].No, thank you. We cannot solve this [inaudible] and this program will be worse because they will more overtime work because their work [inaudible] work at site, our argument is [inaudible]. And this, they don't talk about companies and economy, but we consider about companies and economy. It's because the company's economy-- this motion is in Japan, so [inaudible]-- Japanese company's competitiveness will be decreased or decline or [inaudible] a Japanese competitiveness will be lower than now. And it means Japanese economy will decline, will be effected [inaudible]. So we're thinking of the workers. We're thinking of all the workers in the companies and the economy. This motion is only [inaudible], therefore, [inaudible] oppose this motion. Thank you. [applause].
All our citizens have right to work. We should respect rights on said working condition, which everyone can work comfortably. What our ideal society is this, a normal worker, a new worker, a woman, the both of them can work easily and comfortably. Government should make this ideal society. It's our dream to see worker increase relaxing time, refresh time is important. Also, [inaudible] time is very important. In their first arguments, their contradictions is happen because they talked about, after taking a [inaudible], much of work, no change. However, worker be work until nights and also, it's connected decreasing salary. If a much our work not changed, decreasing salary would happen. Sorry. Also, the first and second point, between this contradictions happen because their first argument talked about much of work-- after taking a [inaudible], much of work won't change. However, their second argument talked about after taking [inaudible], much work will change-- decrease, sorry, so profit will decline. However, their first argument talked about someone to work for change so profit won't decline after taking [inaudible]. Also, even if it is much work changed, observe second points, they could employ new worker, woman and [inaudible] and [inaudible] can make this ideal society, so how it's [inaudible]. 
What we want to say, our second argument is that there are many woman who can work comfortably. However, after taking this [inaudible], government can says these kind of ideal society, so a lot of woman can work more comfortably. Our first segment talks about [inaudible] work-life balance by promoting their health. Take balance work and life is very important. Opposition talked about, after taking [inaudible] life will decrease because decrease in income. However, present situation, work is big rather than life, so it's very unbalanced. However, also taking [inaudible], this balance can take. Opposition's first point is very unclear because how much salary will decrease. Also, [inaudible] is a benefit on career. However, after taking [inaudible], they can earn money, also, they can use this money, so it's work-life balance. And this is our ideal society, so governments should [inaudible] ideal society, so we strongly propose this motion. Thank you. [applause]
